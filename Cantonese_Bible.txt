16 And Jacob begat Joseph the
husband of Mary, of whom was born
Jesus, who is called Christ.
17 So all the generations from
Abraham to David are fourteen
generations; and from David until
the carrying away into Babylon are
fourteen generations; and from the
carrying away into Babylon unto
Christ are fourteen genera ti ass.
18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ
was oti this wise: When as his moth-
er Mary \\in espoused to Joseph^
before they came together, she was
fount:] with child of the Holy Ghost.
19 Then Joseph her husband
being a just man t and not willing
to make her a pubhe example, was
minded to put her away privily,
20 But while he thought on these
tih ngs, behold the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream,
sayings Joseph, thou son of David,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
wife i for that which is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost,
21 And she shall bring forth a son,
and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
for he shall save his people from
their sins.
22 Now all this was dome, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken
of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child,
and shall bring: forth a soa, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel which
being interpreted is, God with us.
24 Then Joseph being raised from
sleep u as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him and took unto him
his wife:
25 And know her not till she had
brought forth her firstborn son:
and he called his name JESUS.

14.亞所生撒鐸、撒鐸生亞金、亞金生以律。
15.以律生以利亞撒、以利亞撒生馬.、馬.生雅各。
16.雅各生約瑟、卽係馬利亞嘅丈夫馬利亞生耶穌稱爲基督。
17.噉樣自亞伯拉罕起、到大闢共十四代、自大闢起、到被搬去巴比倫之時亦係十四代、自搬到巴比倫起、到基督、又係十四代。〇
18.耶穌基督出世、列明在後佢母親馬利亞係已經許聘約瑟、但未會成婚、覺得佢受聖靈感動嚟懷孕。
19.佢個丈夫約瑟係公義嘅人、唔肯顯然羞辱佢、就想靜中退親。
20.正在想開呢的事個時、主嘅使者在夢中現顯過佢、話、大闢嘅後裔約瑟呀、唔怕娶你嘅妻馬嚟亞因爲佢所懷之孕、你從聖靈感動嘅、
21.佢將來生個仔、你就改佢名做耶穌、因佢要救佢百姓出罪惡中嘅。
22.但凡呢的事做成、就應嘵主託先知所講、話、
23.睇.、將來有個未嫁嘅女、懷孕生仔、人哋呌佢名做以馬內利、繙譯卽係神同埋我哋。
24.約瑟瞓醒起身、依住主嘅使者吩咐去做、就娶佢妻。
25.但唔共佢同房、致到佢生仔、就改佢名做耶穌。

CHAPTER II.
1 NOW when Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judea in the
days of Herod the king, behold,
there came wise men from the east
to Jerusalem,
2 Saying, Where is be that is
born King of the Jews, for we
have seen his star in the east, and
are come to worship him.
3 When Herod the king had
heard these things, he was trouble 屯
and all Jerusalem with him.
4 And when he had gathered
all the chief priests and scribes
of the people together, he demanded
of them where Christ should be born.
5 And they said unto him; In
Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
written by the prophet^
6 And thou Bethlehem> in the
land of Juda, art not the least
among; the princes of Juda: for
out of thee shall come a Governors
that shall rule my people Israel.
7 Then Herod when he had
privily called the wise men, inquired
of them diligently what time the
star appeared.
8 And he sent them to Bethlehem,
end Go and search diligently for
the young child ., and when ye have
found him, bring me word again, that
I may come and worship him also.
9 When they had heard the king,
they departed; and, lo the star,
which they saw to the east, went
before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was,
10 When they saw the star, they
rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
11 ¶ And when they were come
into the house they saw the young
child with Mary his mother 9 and fell
down, and worshipped him; and when
they had Opened their treasure^
they presented onto him gifts, gold,
and frankincense, and myrrh.

1.當希律王個時、耶穌既喺猶太伯利恒出世、有幾位博土、喺東便嚟到耶路撒冷、
2.話、生出嚟做猶太人王嘅喺邊處呢因我哋喺東便、聲見佢粒星、故此嚟拜佢
3.希律王聽聞、就慌起嚟通耶路撒冷都係。
4.噉就呌齊衆祭司辰、同民間.書人嚟問、話基督應該喺邊處出世呢。
5.衆人對佢話喺猶太伯利恒因爲先知有寫落噉話、
6.猶太地伯利恒呀、你喺猶太府縣中、唔係至小嘅因爲將來有個君王喺你處出嚟保養我以色列百性嘅。
7.於是希律靜靜呌個的博士嚟、細問個粒星、你幾時現出。
8.就打發佢哋去伯利恒話你去落力査問個細佼仔、搵看、就話過我知、等我亦去拜佢。
9.博士聽見王所講、就起行去咯、忽然在東便所見個粒星喺前頭引佢哋、引到個細佼仔所住個處、就止在佢上頭。
10.博士睇見個粒星、歡.到了不得。
11.入到屋裏、見細交仔、同埋佢母親馬利亞、就跪倒拜個細佼仔打開佢嘅寶盒、.禮物獻上、卽係黃金乳香沒藥。

St. MATTHEW, II.
12 And being warned of God in
& dream that they should not return
to Herod 5 they departed into their
own country another way,
13 And when they were depart-
ed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream,
saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and flee into
Egypt, and be thou there until I
bring thee word: for Herod will seek
the young child to destroy him.
14 When he arose, he took the
young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt:
15 And was there until the death
of Herod: that it might be fulfilled
^which was spoken of the Lord by
the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt
have I called my son,
16 ¶ Then Herod, when he saw
that he weth moeked of the 'wifeti men,
was exceeding wroth, and sent forth,
and slew all the children that were
in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
thereof, from two years old and
under, according to the time which
he had diligently inquired of the
wise men,
17 Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saying,
18 In Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation, and weepings
and great mourning, Rachel weeping
for her children and wmild not be
comforted because they are not.
19 But when Herod was dead,
behold, an angel of the Lord ap-
peareth is a dream to Joseph in
Egypt,
20 Saying, Arise, and take the
young child and his mother, and go
into the land of Israel: for they are
dead which sought the young child's
life,
21 And he arose, and took the
young child and his mother, and
came into the land of Israel.

12.愽士喺夢中得默示、呌咪番去希律處、就喺別條路番歸本土。〇
13.佢哋去之後、主嘅使者、在夢中顯現過約瑟、話、起身、帶個細佼仔、同埋佢母親、走去埃及、喺個處等我指點你、因爲希律將要找尋個細他佼仔嚟殺佢。
14.約瑟卽時起身、帶個細仔、同佢母親、漏夜走去埃及。
15.喺個處、至到希律死曉瞰就應曉、主託先知所講、話、已經呌我子出埃及咯。
16.個陣希律既知到被博士欺.倒、就極惱使人將伯到、恒與及個處附近嘅地方、所有細佼仔、依住細問博士個時、但凡自兩歲以下嘅、盡哋殺.噉。
17.就應嘵 先知耶利米所講、話、
18.喺拉馬地方、聽聞呌喊深傷嘅聲、拉結氏喊佢仔、因冇得留存、所以唔受安慰。
19.希律死嘵、主嘅使者、喺埃及處、在夢中顯現過約瑟、
20.話、起身、帶個細佼仔、同佢母親、去以色列地方、因個的找尋細抆仔性命嘅、己經死咯佢就起身、帶
個細佼仔同佢母親、嚟到以色列地方。

22 But when he heard that Arclie-
laus did reign in Judea in the room
of his father Herod, he was afraid to
go thither: notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a dream, he turned
aside into the parte of Galilee i
23 And he came and dwelt in a
city called Nazareth: that it
be fulfilled which was spoken by the
pIiets. He shall be called a
prophets
Ka^aren'
a^arene.

CHAPTER III,
1 IN those days came John the Bap-
tist, preaching in the wilderness
of Judea,
2 And saying, He pent ye:  for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand,
3 For this is he that was spoken
of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his paths straight.
4 And the same John had his
raiment of camels hair: and a leath-
ern girdle about his loins; and his
meat was locusts and wild honey.
5 Then went out to him Jeru-
salem, and all Judea and all the
region round about Jordan,
6 And were baptised of him in
Jordan, confessing their sins,
7 Hat when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
baptism, he said unto them, O gen-
eration of vipers, who hath warned
you to from the wrath to come,
8 Bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance:
9 And thank not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham to
our father: for I say unto you, that
God h able of these stones to raise
up children unto Abraham.
10 And now also the axe is kid
unto the root of the trees: therefore
every tree which bringeth not: forth
good fruit la hewn down, and cast
into the fire.

22.但係聞得亞基老喺猶太繼住父親做王、就怕去個處、惟係在夢中得默示、故此番去加利利境地。
23.到一個城、名呌拿撒勒、就喺處居住、撖就應曉衆先知所講、人哋將要呌佢做拿撤勒人咯。

第三章


1.當個陣時、施洗禮嘅約翰嚟到、喺猶太曠野傳道、話、
2.你哋當要悔改、因爲天國近咯。
3.呢個人就係先知以賽亞所講嘅、話、在曠野有人聲喓話、預備主大路整直佢小路。
4.呢個約翰、所.係駝毛、腰束皮帶、所食嘅係蝗蟲野蜜。
5.個陣時、耶路撒冷通猶太與及約但四方嘅人、都嚟親就佢、
6.衆人認自己罪、喺約但河受佢洗禮。
7.約翰睇見好多o法唎賽人、同埋撒吐該人嚟受佢嘅洗禮、就對佢哋話、毒蛇之類呀、邊個敎你避後來嘅震怒呢。
8.所以當結果合於悔改。
9.你哋心中咪話、我哋有亞伯拉罕係祖宗呀、因爲我話你知、神能將呢的石做亞伯拉罕嘅子孫。
10.如今斧頭已經擠落樹脚、但凡樹木唔結好杲嘅、就斬嘵.落火處。

16 And Jesus, when he was,

thee; and in their hands they shall
bear thee up, lest at any time thou

7 Jesus said unto him. It is
written again, Thou shalt not tempt

8 Again, the devil tuketh him
up into an exceeding high moimtiun^
and sheweth him all the kingdoms
of the world, mu] the glory of them;
0 And saith unto him, All these
things will I give thee, if thou wilt
fall down and worship me.
10 Then saith .Jesus unto him t
Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
written thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt

11 Then the devil loavcOi him,

7.耶穌對佢話、聖書又有寫、你唔好試主、你嘅神。
8.魔鬼又帶佢上好高嘅山、.天下列國、及列國嘅榮華俾佢睇。
9.又對佢話、你若跪下拜我、我.呢的俾嘥過你。
10.耶穌就對佢話、撒但退囉、因爲聖書有話、你當拜主你嘅神、獨係.事佢。
11.於是魔鬼離開耶穌、又有天使嚟服事佢。〇
12.耶穌聞得約翰被押住、就去加利利。
13.又離開拿撒勒到迦百農處住、個的地方係海邊、在西布倫納大利境內。

Simon called Peter, and Andrew his
brother, casting a net into the sea;
for they were fishers.
19 And be faith unto them,
Follow me, and I will make you
fishers of men.
20 And they straightway left
their nets, and followed him.
21 And going on from thence,
he saw other two brethren, James
the son of Zebedee, and Jo I ni his
brother, in a ship with Zebedee
their father, mending their nets;
and he called them.
22 And they immediately left the
ship and their father, and followed
him.
23 ¶ And Jesus went about all
Galilee f teaching in their synagogues^
and preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and healing sill manner of
sickness and all maimer of disease
among the people,
24 And his fame went throughout
all Syria: and they brought unto
him all sick people that were taken
with divers diseases and lonnents,
and those which were possessed with
devils, and those which were lunatic,
and those that had the palsy; and
he healed them.
2 ¶ And there followed him great
multitudes of people from Galilee,
and from Decapolis and from
Jerusalem, and from Judea, and
from beyond Jordan.
CHAPTER V,
1 AND seeing the multitudes, he

St. MATTHEW V.
4 Blessed are they that men in:
for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they
shall Inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do
liuuger and thir.st after righteous^
ness: for they sha]l be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for
they shall obtain mercy,
8 Blessed are the pure in heart:
for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers r
for they shall be called the children
of God.
Blessed are they which are
persecuted for: righteousness’ sake:
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,
11 Blessed are ye f when men
shall revile you s and persecute you,
and shall say all manner of evil
against you falsely, for my sake,
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding
^lad: for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecuted they the
prophets which were before you.
13 Ye are the salt or the earth:
but if the gait have lost Isis savotir,
wherewith shall it be salted, it is
thenceforth good for nothing but
to be cast out f find to W trodden
under foot of in^.a.
14 Ye are the light of the world
A city that is set on a hill cannot
be hid.
15 Neither do mm light a can-
dle, and put it under a bushel,
but on a candlestick; and it giveth
light unto all that are in the house.
16 Let your light so shine before
men t that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father
which is in heaven,
17 Think not that I am come
to destroy the law, or the prophets:
I have not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.

4.悲. 嘅人有福咯、因爲佢必得安慰呀。
5.溫柔嘅人有福咯、因爲佢必得土地呀。
6.如.渴愛慕公義嘅人有福咯、因爲佢必得飽呀、
7.可憐人嘅有福咯、因爲佢必受可憐呀。
8.清心嘅人有福咯、因爲佢必得見神呀。
9.令人和睦嘅人有福咯、因爲佢必得稱爲神之子呀。
10.爲公義被人迫害嘅人有福咯、因爲天國係佢嘅國呀。
11.你爲我受人怒罵迫害你又抓各樣惡.嚟毀謗你、就有福咯
12.你戁該歡壹快欒因爲你得在天嘅賞賜係大呀、在你哋以前嘅先知、都係噉樣被人迫害咯。〇
13.你係地嘅鹽、倘若鹽失曉.道、點成得番鹽呢、後來必定冇用、獨係永曉出外、任人踹踏呮。
14.你係世上嘅光一個城起倒山上係不能遮掩嘅。
15.人嘅點燈、唔抓嚟擠倒斗下、惟係擠倒燈枱上就照住一家嘅人。
16.噉樣你哋嘅光、當要照在人前、令佢睇見你嘅好行爲、就歸榮你在天嘅父。〇
17.咪以爲我嚟壞律法.及先知我唔係嚟廢壞正係成就佢呀。

18 For verily I say unto you,
Till heaven and earth pass, erne
jot Of onte tittle shall iti no wise
from the law, till all be fulfilled.
Whosoever therefore filial 1
break one of these least command-
ments, and shall teach men to, he
shall be called the least in the king-
dom of heaven: but whosoever shall
do and teach the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven,
20 For Isay unto you, That except
your righteousness shall exeaiKi the
righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall is no case enter
into the kingdom of heaven.
21  Ye have heard that it was
said by them of old time, Thou shall,
not kill; and whosoever shall kill
elittll be in danger of the judgment:
22 But I say unto you, That
whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger
of the judgment: and whosoever
shall say to his brother, Eaca, shall
be in danger of the eoimeil, but
whosoever shall say, Thou fbo】, shall
be in danger of hell fire.
23 Therefore if IImu bring thy
gift to the altar, and there remem-
berest that thy brother hath aught
against thee;
24 Leave there thy gift before
the altar, and go thy way, first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then
come and offer thy gift.
l 2h Agree with thine adversary
quickly/ while thou art in the way
with him; lest at any time the
adversary deliver thee to the jEK%o,
and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and thou be cast into prison.
26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou
shalt by no means come out thenoe,
till thou hmt paid the uttermost
farthing,
27 Ye have heard that it was
said by them of old lime, Thou shalt
not commit adultery:

18.我實在話你知直到天地廢壞、律法一點一畫斷不能廢壤、一的都得成就嘅。
19.故此但凡毁壤呢的試命至微小嘅一條、又敎人噉樣做喺天國必定話佢係至微小、惟係但凡遵依試命嚟做、及敎人嘅、喺天國必定話佢係大咯。
20.我話你知倘若你嘅善義唔勝得過讀書人與及法利.人嘅善義、斷唔入得天國。
21.你聞得有對過古人話咪殺人、佴凡殺人嘅。就難免審利治罪、
22.但我話你知、但凡無故惱怒兄弟嘅、難免審利治罪、但凡對兄弟話係.利嘅、.加.利俱罵人唔難免地獄嘅火。
23.故此你若係擰禮物去壇喺個處記起兄弟有乜嘢罪執得你、
24.就留落你禮物喺壇前、先去共你兄弟和好番然後嚟獻你禮物。
25.有吿訟你若嘅你重共佢喺路上、要急的共佢和好、恐怕吿你嘅送你到官、官發你落差、你就被押在監裹咯。
26.我實在話你知、倘若你一毫一.未會䢙還淸、斷不能喺個處出得嚟。
27.你聞得有話、咪行姦淫。

St. MATTHEW V.
章 五’ 第 JC 馬

28 But I say unto you That
whosoever looketh on a woman to
lust after her hath committed adul-
tery with her already in his heart.
29 And if thy right eye offend
thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
thee: for it is profitable for thee that
one of thy members should perish,
and not that thy whole body should
be ca«t into hell
30 And if thy right hand offend
thee, cut it off; and cast it from
thee: for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy members should
perish, and not that thy whole body
should be cast into hell.
31 It hath been said, Whosoever
shall put away his wife, let him give
her a writing of divorcement:
32 But I say unto you, That
whosoever shall put away his wife,
saving for the cause of foroication,
can set l l ker to commit adultery:
and whosoever shall marry her that
is divorced committeth adultery.
33 A gala, ye have heard that it
hath been said by them of old time,
Thou shalt not forswear thyself but
shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths;
54 But I say unto you, Swear not
at all; neither by heaven; for it IS
God’s throne:
55 Nor by the earth; for it is his
footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for
it is the city of the great King,
36 Neither shalt thou swear by
thy head, because thou canst not
make one hair white or black.
37 But let your communication be,
Yea, yea; Nay, Nay: for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil.
38 I[ Ye have heard that it hath
been said, An eye for an eye f and a
tooth for a tooth: t
39 But I say onto you, That ye
resist not evil: but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other 杜 IS。.

28.但係我對你話但凡弟見婦人就動起淫心、佢心裹行姦淫咯。
29.設使右眼陷你犯罪、就挖嘵𢫕佢、可寍百體失嘵一體、免致全身打落地獄。
30.設使右手陷你犯罪、就斬斷𢫕佢、寍可百體失體、免致全身落地獄。〇
31.又有話若係有人出個妻、就要寫分書俾過佢。
32.但係我對你話、但凡唔係因姦淫嘅緣故出佢妻、就係使佢行淫咯、人若娶個被出嘅婦人、亦係行淫咯。〇
33.你又聞得有對過古人話、你所發嘅誓、唔好違背、對主發誓嘅、必要依番嚟做。
34.但係我話、總唔好發誓、唔好指天嚟誓、因爲天係神嘅座位呀、
35.唔好指地嚟誓因爲地係佢嘅.凳呀、唔好指耶路撒冷嚟誓因耶路撒冷係京都呀、
36.又唔好指自己頭嚟誓、因你不能使得一條頭髪或白呀。
37.但你哋嘅說話、要是是否否多、過呢的嘅、係由惡發出嚟咯。〇
38.你聞得有話、(手戒)眼賠眼、(手戒)牙賠牙。
39.但係我對你話你咪共惡做對敵、若有人打你右便腮頬、就調轉左便俾佢打。

St. MATTHEW VI,
40 And if any man will sue thee
sit the law, and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak also.
41 And wl in 糾 ever shall compel
thee to go a mile, go with him twain,
42 Give to him that asketh thee,
and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away,
43 ¶ Ye lmy& heard that it hath
been said, Thou shalt love thy neigh-
bor r, and hate thine enemy.
44 But I say unto you, Love your
enemies, bless them that curs you.
do good to them that \uxte you, and
pray for them which clespitftfully
use you, and perseente you;
45 That ye rimy be the children
of your Father which is in heaven:
for he maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust,
46 For if ye love them which love
you, what reward have ye, do not
even the publicans the same,
47 And if ye salute your brethren
only, what do ye more than others f
do not even the publicans so,
48 Be ye therefore perfect even
as your Father which is in Heaven
is perfect.
CHAPTER VI.
r TAKE heed that ye <\q not your
_L before man f to be seen of
them: otherwise yo have no reward
of your Father which is in heaven.
2 Therefore when thou doest
thine aim% do not sound a trumpet
before thee, as the hypocrites do in
the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have glory of men.
verily If,a, unto you, They have
their reward,
3 But when thou doest alms, let
not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth:
4 That thine alms may be in secret:
and thy Father which seeth in secret
himself shall reward thee openly.

40.若有人想吿你, 取你裹便衣服連外便衣服都由得佢取。
41.有人勉强你行一里路、你就共佢行二里路。
42..你嘅就俾過佢、想共你借嘅咪榷辭佢。〇
43.你聞得有話要愛你嘅鄰舎懀你仇敵。
44.但係我對你話、共你做仇敵嘅要愛佢難爲你嘅要替佢祈祈幬。
45..樣就可以做得你天父嘅仔咯因佢出熱頭嚟照善人及惡人、落雨喺義人及不義人處呀。
46.你若係愛個的愛你嘅、有乜賞賜私.税吏亦嗒(咯)係瞰樣做咩
47.步淨係問你兄弟安、有乜好過人呢異邦人亦唔係噉樣做咩
48.所以你當要做到完全好似你天父係完全嘅呀。

第六章。

1.至緊咪喺人面前行善令人睇見、若係噉、就唔得你天父嘅賞賜咯。
2.所以你施捨個時、咪吹響角喺你面前、好似僞善嘅人、喺會堂與及街.所做等人俾體面佢我實在詁(話)你知佢已經得倒佢嘅賞賜咯。
3.但係你施捨個時味俾左手知到右手所做令你施捨嘅事在暗中嚟做你父就在暗中處鑒察必定報答你。

IS
I, 1[ And when thou prayest, thou
ehflit not be as the hypocrites <tre:
for they love to pray standing in
the synagogues and in the corners
of the street、that they ma, be
seen of men. Verily I say unto you,
They have their reward,
6 But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet) and when thou
I last shut thy door; pray to thy Fa-
ther which is in secret; and thy
Father which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray > use not vain
repetitions in the heathen do: for
they think that they shall be heard
for their much speaking.
8 Be not ye therefore like unto
them: for your Father knoweth
what things ye have need of, before
ye ask him.
9 After this manner therefore
pray ye: Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will
be done in earth, in it is in heaven
11 Give us this day our daily
bread
12 And forgive us our debts, as
we forgive our debtors.
13 And lead us not into tempta-
tion but deliver in from evil:
for thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, for ever.
Amen,
14 For if ye forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father
will also forgive you:
15 But if ye forgive not men
their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses,
16 ¶ Moreover when ye fast, be
not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
countenance i for they disfigure their
faces, that they may appear unto men
to fast. Verily I say unto you,
They have their reward.
17 But thou, when thou fastest^
anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

5.〇你祈禱個時、咪似僞善嘅人、因爲佢好企倒會堂、及大街嘅路口禱、令人睇見、我實在話你知、佢己佢己倒佢嘅賞賜唂。
6.但你嘅祈禱個時、入你密室之中、閂埋門祈禱你暗中嘅父、你父在暗中處鑒察、必定報答你。
7.你哋祈禱個時、說話咪賛累、好似異邦人娵樣、因爲佢哋以爲說話多、至得聽聞嘅。
8.所以你哋唔好學佢哋因爲你未求佢之先你父知到你需用嘅咯。
9. 故此你哋祈禱、當要瞰樣話、我哋嘅父在天、願你嘅名係聖。
10.你嘅國降臨、你嘅旨意得成就、在地好似在天一樣。
11.我哋需用嘅糧、今日賜。
12.我又绝我哋嘅次負、好似我哋免曉人欠負我嘅。
13.咪引我哋入誠惑、拯救哋出罪惡、因爲國呀、權呀、榮呀、皆係你有、至世到世、誠心所願。
14.你哋若係免人哋嘅罪過、你天父都免你嘅罪過、
15.倘若你哋唔免人哋嘅罪過你父亦唔免你嘅罪過。〇
16.你哋禁食個時、咪似僞善嘅、人作憂瑟樣子、因爲佢變嘵面貌、令人睇見佢禁食、實在話你知、佢己經得倒佢嘅賞賜咯。
17.惟係你禁食個時、搽你頭、洗你面。

18 That thou appear not unto
men to jfast, but unto thy Father
which is in secret: and thy Father
which seeth in secret shall reward
thee openly.
19 Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earthy where moth
and xmt dod) corrupt, and where
thieves break through and steal:
20 But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves do not break through
nor steal:
21 For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.
22 The light of the body is the
eye: If therefore thine eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of
light
23 But if thine be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of darkness.
If therefore the light that is in thee
be darkness; how great is that
darkness.
24,[ No man can .serve two mm-
ters: for either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else
he will hold to the one, and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon.
25 Therefore I say unto you 5
Take no thought for your life, what
ye shall or what ye shall drink;
nor yet for your body, what y ^'shall
put on is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment,
26 Behold the fowls of the air:
for they sow not, neither do they
nov gather into barns; yet
you r heavenly Father feedeth them.
Are ye not much better than they,
27 Which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit unto his
stature,
28 And why take ye thought
for raiment, Consider the lilies of
the field, bow they grow, they
toil not, neither do they spin i

18.至到你禁食唔現出過人見、但係現出過你暗中嘅父見、瞰你父在暗中處鑒察、必定報答你。〇
19.咪積埋財帛喺地上、卽係蟲噌食、銹噌壤、與及盜賊可以開龍嚟偸個處。
20.但要爲自己積埋財帛喺天上、冇蟲食、冇銹壞、與及盜賊唔開龍嚟偸個處。
21.因爲你財帛所在、你心亦在個處呀。〇
22.眼就係身嘅燈哩、你眼睛若係明、你就一身都光。
23.你眼睛若係矇就你一身都暗故此你嘅光若係暗、個的暗就好大咯。〇
24.冇人能服事得兩個主人因爲佢必定懀呢個、愛個個、或睇重呢個、睇輕個個、你不能服事神又服事財帛呀。
25.故此我話你哋知、你唔使憂慮你生命食乜 .、或飮乜 . 你身體.乜.、生命唔係貴重過食物咩、身體唔係.重過衣服咩。
26.試睇吓天上嘅雀烏吖、佢唔耕種、唔收割、唔秸蓄上倉.你天父尙且養佢你唔係貴重過雀烏咩。
27.你哋也誰因憂慮能長多一刻生命呢。
28.你乜使爲衣服憂慮呢、試想吓荒野個的白合花、點樣生.、佢唔勞九、唔紡織。

St, MATTHEW VIx,
29 And yet I say unto you, That
even Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of those.
30 Wherefore, if God so clotho
the grass of the field, which to
day is, and to morrow is cast into
the oven, shall he not much more
clothe you, o ye of little faith,
31 Therefore take no thought,
saying, What shall we eat, or,
What shall we drink, or, Where-
withal shall we be clothed,
32 (lfor after all these things
do the Gentiles seek:) for your
heavenly Father knoweth Omt ye
have Deed of M th 咖 things,
33 But seek first the kingdom of
God, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added onto you,
34 Take therefore no thought
for the morrow: for the morrow
shall take thought for the things
of itself. Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof,
CHAPTER VIL .
JUDGE not, that ye be not judged,
2 For with what judgment ye
judge, ye shall be judged: and
with what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you again.
3 And why be boldest thou the
mote that is in thy brother's eye^
but considerest not the beam that
is in thine own eye V
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy
brother. Let me pull out the mote
out of thine eye; and, behold, a
beam is in thine own eye,
5 T3;on hypocrite, first cast out
the beam out of thine own eye;
and then shalt thou see clearly
to cast out the mote out of thy
brother’s eye.
6 ¶ Give not that which is holy
unto they dogs, neither cast ye your
pesrls before sivine, lest they trample
them under their feet; and turn
again and rend you.

29.但係我話你知、卽使所羅門.榮華之時、佢所着都唔似得呢的花一朶。
30.至於野外嘅草、今日尙在、明日就.落爐、神尙且撖樣裝飾佢、何况你哋小信嘅人呢。
31.故此唔使憂慮話、我哋食乜嘢或飮乜嘢、或着乜嘢。
32.因爲呢的都係異邦人所求嘅、惟係天父知到呢的嘢都係你哋要用嘅。
33.伹你碱先求神嘅國與及佢公義、撖佢必定將呢的另外俾過你咯。
34.故此咪爲明日憂慮因爲明日嘅.、明日至憂憂慮、一日嘅勞苦、一日就够咯、

1.咪議論人、就唔被人議論你。
2.因爲你撖樣議論、就被人瞰樣議論你、你瞰樣量度人就被人瞰樣量度你。
3.你兄弟眼裏有條莉你就睇見、你自己眼裏有條杉、你自己都唔見覺、爲乜呢你自己服尙且有條杉、點能對兄弟話、你眼有條䓶、等我替你(擝?)出嚟昵。

7 ¶ Ask, and it shall be given
you, seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you:
8 For every one that asketh
received t; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh
it shall be opened,
9 Or what man is there of you,
whom if his son ask breads will
he give him a stone,
10 Or if be ask a feti, will he
give him a serpent,
11 If ye then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts unto your
children, much more shall
your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask
him,
12 Therefore all things whatso-
ever ye wou Id that men should
do to you, do yo even so to them:
for this is the law and the prophets.
15 ¶ Enter ye in at the strait
gs.t6: a>r wide is the gate f and
Sroat is the way, that leadeth to
destruction and many there be
ivhicu go in thereat.
14 Because strait is the gate, and
narrow is the way, which leadeth

3 ¶ I| Beware of false prophets,
which come to you in sheep’s cloth-
ing, but inwartlly they are ravening

16 Yc shall know them by their

17 Even so every good tree bnag-
eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
tree brin^oth forth evil fruit,
15 A g^ood tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit,
19 Every tree that bringeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down, QDd
cast int.o the fire.
20 Wherefore by their fruits ye
shall know them.

7.〇你哋求就必俾你、搵就心遇着、打門就心開過你。
8.因爲但凡求嘅就得、搵嘅就遇着、打門嘅就得開呀。
9.你哋之中、邊個有仔求餅、俾石過佢呢、
10.或者求魚俾蛇過佢呢。
11.你哋雖係惡、尙且知到俾好嘢過仔女、可况你父在天、有唔;好嘢賜過求佢嘅咩。
12.所以你哋但凡想人撖樣待你、你是必要撖樣待人、因爲呢的係律法與及先知嘅恴思呀。〇
13.你應該入個度窄門、因爲引人
到沉淪處、個度門係闊、個條路係大、又入去個處嘅係多。
14.但係引人到生活處、個度門係窄、個條路係細、又榲得着嘅係多少。〇
15.你哋提防個的爲先知、佢嚟你處、外面裝或羊咩撖、裹頭實係殘惡職豺狼。
16.因佢嘅果子、就可以識得佢出哩、喺.棘摘得倒善提子咩、喺蔾蒺摘得倒無花果咩。
17.瞰樣但凡善樹結善果、惡樹結惡果。
18.善樹不能結惡果、惡樹不能結善果。
19.但凡樹木唔結善果嘅、就斬曉.落火處、

St, MATTHEW VIII

21  Not every one that saith
unto me, Lorct Lord) shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father I^hich in
an heaven.
22 Many ivill say to mein thatdaj,
pard, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name, and in the name
have east out devils, and in thy
name done many wonderful works,
2 And then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you: depart
fk»in me, ye that work iniquity,
24 Therefore whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine 9 and doeth
thepi, I will liken hiimmtoa wise ruan,
which built his house upon a rock:
25 And the rain descended, and the
floods came, and the wiada blew, and
beat; upon that house  and it fell
not: for it was fauuded upon a rock.
s6 And every one that heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them not f
shall be likened unto a foolish man,
which built hh house upon the sand:
27 And the rain descmded, and
the floods came, and the winds
Wew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell: and great was the fall of it.
28 And it earae to pass, when
Jesus had ended these sayings,
the people were astonished at his
doctdne:
29 For he taught them as arte
hftying authority and not E 5 the
scribes.
CHAPTER VIII
"TTTHEF he was come down from

2 And, behold, there came a

11 And into whatsoever city or
town ye shall enter, inquire who in

go thence.
12 And when ye come into a house,
salute it_
13 And if the lion^e be worthy, let
your peace come upon it: but if it be
not worthy let your peace return to
you,
14 And whosoever shall not receive
you, nor hear your words, when ye
depart out of that house or city, shake
off the dust of your feet
15 verily I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that city,

will deliver you up to the councils,
and they will scourge you in their

governors and kings for my sake, for
a testimony against them and the
Gentiles.

CHAPTER XI
1 AND it came to when Jesus
had made an end of com-
manding his twelve disciple he
departed thence to teach and to
preach in their cities.
2 Now when John had heard in
the prison the works of Christ, he
sent two of his disciples»
3 And said unto him, Art thou he
that should come or do we look for
another,
4 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Go and shew John again those
things which ye do hear and see:
5 The blind receive their sight,
and the lame walk, the lepers are
d caused; and the deaf hear, the dead
are raised up, and the poor have the
gospel preached to them,
6 And blessed is he f whosoever
shall not be offended is me.
7 ¶ And as they departed, Jesus
began in say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out
into the wilderness to see, A reed
si ] a ken with the wind,
8 But what went ye out for to
see, A man clothed hi soft raiment,
behold, they that wear soft clothing
are in kings’ houses.
9 But what went ye out for to 鄉？
A prophet, yea, I say unto you, and
more than a prophet,
10 For this is he of whom it is
written, Behold, I send my messenger
before thy face, which shall prepare
thy way before thee,
11 Verily I say unto you, Among
them that are born of women there
hath not risen a greater than John
the Baptist: notwithstanding he that
is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he.
12 And from the days of John the
Baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and the
violent take it by force.

St. MATTHEW XI
13 For all the prophets and the
law prophesied until Join).
14 And if ye will receive ■,'f, this
is which was for to oonie.
15 He that luvth ears to hear, let
him hear,
16 ¶ But ^hereunto shall I liken
this generation, It is like unto
children sitting in the markets, and
calling unto their fellows,
17 And saying, We have piped
unto you, and ye have not danced;
we have mourned unto you, and ye
have not lamented.
18 For John came neither eating
nor drinking, and they said,He hath
a devil.
19 The Son of man came eating
and drinking, and they said, Behold
a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber,
a friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is justified of her
children.
20 ¶ Then began he to upuraid
the cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done, because they re-
pented not:
21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin I woe
unto thee, Bethsaida I for if the
mighty works which were done in
you had been done in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have repented long
ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 But I say unto you It shall be
more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
at the day of judgment, than for
you.
23 And thou Capernaum > which
art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
brought down to hell: for if the
mighty works, which have been clone
in thee, had been done in Sodom,
it would have remained until this
day.
24 But I say unto you. That it
shall be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom in the day of judgment,
than for thee.

13.因爲衆先知及律法、預先講嘅、至到約翰。

16.但我(械?)乜嘢嚟比較呢個世代呢好比細佼仔坐倒市上、呌佢同班輩嘅話。
17.我哋對住你吹簫、你唔跳舞、我哋唱哀歌、你唔啼哭。
18.因爲約翰嚟到、唔飮唔食、人哋話佢係被鬼迷。
19.人子嚟到又飯又食人哋話、睇吓、個好飮好食嘅人、係税吏罪人嘅朋友、惟係智慧嘅仔個個都明智義慧嘅呀。〇
20.個陣時、耶穌引自己行過至多異跡嘅城嚟.成、因佢唔悔改、
21.就噉話、哥拉汛你有禍咯、伯賽大你有禍咯、因爲喺你哋處所行嘅異跡、倘若行在推羅西頓、佢就大早着麻衫、坐倒灰處嚟悔改咯。
22.但係我話你知、當審判之日、推羅西頓嘅刑罰、比較你嘅更易受呀。
23.迦百農呀、你得升高到天咩、將來必推落地獄咯、因爲喺你處所行嘅異跡若係行在所多馬處、佢是必今日重存。

St. MATTHEW XII

25 At that time Jesus answered
and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because
thou host hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed
them unto babes.
26 Even so, Father; for be it
seemed good in thy sight.
27 All things are delivered unto
me of my Father: and no one
knoweth the Son, but the Father:
neither knoweth any man the Father,
save the Son, and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him.
28 ¶ Come unto me, all who
labour and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me; for I am meek and
lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.
30 for my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light,
CHAPTER XII
I that time Jesus went on the
sabbath day through the corn,
and his disciples were a hungered,
and began to pluck the ears of corn,
and to eat,
2 But when the Pharisees saw it,
they said unto him, Behold, thy
disciples do that which is not lawful
to do upon the sabbath day.
3 But he said unto them, Have ye
not read what David did, when he
was a hungered, and they that were
with him;
4 How he entered into the house
of God, and did eat the shewbread,
which was not lawful for him to eat,
neither for them which were with
him, but only for the priests,
5 Or have ye not read in the law,
how that on the sabbath days the
priests in the temple profane the
sabbath, and are blameless,
6 But I say unto you, That in thy
place is one greater than the temple.

2.但係o法唎㘔人睇見、就對佢話、你門生做安息日唔着做嘅事呀。
3.耶穌對佢哋話、大關與及跟佢嘅人肚餓之時、所做嘅事、你哋未曾讀過咩。
4.卽係佢入神殿食個的擺設嘅餅、但個的餅、佢共跟隨佢嘅都唔着食、獨係祭司致食得呮、
5.又律法所載、當安息日、祭司喺殿裹頭、犯安息日、都冇罪、你亦未曾讀過咩。
6.但係我話你哋知呢處有個更大過殿嘅。

7 But if ye had known what this
meaneth, I will have mercy and not
sacrifice, ye would not have con-
demned the guiltless,
8 For the Son of man is Lord even
of the sabbath day.
9 And when he was departed
thence, he went into their synagogue:
10 ¶ And, behold, there was a
man which had his hand withered.
And they asked him, saying Is it
lawful to heal on the sabbath days,
that they might accuse him,
11 And he said unto them, What
man shall there be among you, that
shall have one sheep, and if it fall
into a pit on the sabbath day, will he
not lay hold on it, and lift it out,
12 How much then is a man better
than a sheep, wherefore it is lawful
to do well on the sabbath days,
13 Then saith he to the man,
Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it forth; and it was restored
wholes like in the other.
14 ¶ Then the Pharisees went out,
and had a council against him, how
they might destroy him.
15 But when Jesus knew he
withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitudes followed him, and
he healed them all;
16 And charged them that they
should not make him known;
17 That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
Saying,
18 Behold my servand whom I
have chosen; my beloved, in whom
my soul is well pleased: I will put
my Spirit upon him, and he shall
shew judgment to the Gentiles.
19 He shall not strive nor cry;
neither shall any man hear his voice
in the streets.
20 A bruised reed shall he not
break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, till he send forth judgment
unto victory.

21 And is his name shall the
Gentiles trust.
22 ¶ Then was brought unto him
one possessed with a devil, blind,
and dumb: and he healed him in-
somuch that the blind and dumb
both spake and saw.
23 And all the people were
amazed, and saw, is not this the
Son of David,
24 But when the Pharisees heard
it they said, This fellow doth not
east out devils, but by Beelzebub
the prince of the devils,
25 And Jesus knew their thoughts,
and said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to
desolation; and every city or Wise
divided against itself shall not stand:
26 And if Satan cast out Satan,
he is divided against himself; how
shall then his kingdom stand,
27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils by whom do your children
cast them out, therefore they shall
be your judges,
28 But if I east out devils by the
Spirit of God, then the kingdom of
God is come unto you.
29 Or else, how can one enter into
a strong man's house; and spoil his
good except he first bind the strong
man, and then he will spoil his
house.
30 He that is not with me is

not with me scattereth abroad
31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you,
All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall he forgiven unto men: but the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
shall not be forgiven unto men-
32 And whosoever speaketh a word
against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not
be forgiven him, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come.

24.o法唎㘔人聽見話、呢個趕鬼嘅、無非藉賴鬼王別西卜呮。
25.但係耶穌知到佢恚思、就話、但凡國自己相爭、就必定變爲墟、但凡一城一家自己相爭、必不能立。
26.倘若撒但趕逐撒但、就係自己相爭哩、佢嘅國點能成立呢。
27.若係我藉賴別西卜嚟趕鬼、你嘅子弟、就藉賴乜誰嚟趕鬼呢、故此佢哋將議論你咯。

Even so shall it be also unto this

48 But he answered and said unto

CHAPTER XIII
1 THE same day went Jesus out of
3 the house, and sat by the sea
side.
2 And great multitudes were
gathered together unto him so that
he went into a ship, and sat; and the
whole multitude stood on the shore.
3 And he spake many things unto
them in parables, saying Behold, a
sower went forth to sow;
4 And when he sowed, some seeds
fell by the wayside, and the fowls
came and devoured them up:
5 Some fell upon stony places,
where they had not much earth: and
forthwith they sprang up, because
they had no deepness of earth:

34 MATTHEW XIII,
6 And when the sun was up, they
were scorched, and because they had
no root; they withered away,
7 And some fell among thorns, and
the thorns sprung up, and choked
them:
8 But other fell into good ground,
and brought forth fruit, some a hun-
dredfold some sixty fold, some thirty-
fold.
9 Who hath ears to hear, let him
hear,
10 And the disciples came, and
said unto him, Why speakest thou
unto them in parables,
11 He answered and said unto
them, Because it is given unto you to
know the mysteries of the kingdom
of heaven, but to them it is not given.
12 For whosoever hath to him
shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance: but whosoever hath not,
from him shall be taken away even
that he hath.
13 Therefore speak I to them in
parables: because they seeing see not,
and hearing they hear not neither
do they understand.
14 And in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Esa-is^, which saith: By
hearing shall hear, and shall not
understand, and seeing ye shall see,
and shall not perceive.
15 For tills people’s heart is waxed
groBS, and their ears are dull of hear-
ing, and their eyes they have closed;
lest at any time they should see with
their eyes and hear with their ears,
and should understand with their
heart, and should be converted, and
I should heal them.
16 But blessed are your eyes, for
they see, and your ears, for they hear.
17 For verily I say unto you, That
many prophets and righteous men
have desired to see those things which
ye see, and have not seen them, and
to hear those things which ye hear,
and have not heard them.

10.門生嚟對佢話、做乜同衆人講譬喩呢。
11.耶穌答佢哋話、因爲天國嘅奧妙、賜過你哋知到、惟係唔賜過佢哋。
12.因爲但凡有嘅、必定賜佢、至到有餘、但凡冇嘅、連佢所有、都要奪埋。
13.故此我用譬喩同佢哋講、因爲佢哋睇都睇唔見、聽都聽唔聞又唔曉呀。
14.噉就在呢的人、應嘵以賽亞先知嘅話、你哋聽嘅都聽唔曉、睇嘅都睇唔見。
15.因爲呢的百姓、心係頑梗、佢耳.聽、佢眼自己閉埋、怕到俾聽聞、心中曉得、就噌改變、俾我醫好呀。
16.但係你哋眼有福咯、因爲睇見呀、你哋耳有福咯、因爲聽聞呀。
17.我實在話你哋知、昔日有好多先知與及義人、想見所你見嘅都唔得見、想聞你所聞嘅都唔得聞。

St. MATTHEW XIII,
18 Hear ye therefore the par-
able of the sower,
19 When any one heareth the word
of the kingdom, and understandeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one,
and catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart. This is he which
received seed by the way side,
20 But he that received the seed
into stony places the same is he that
heareth the word, and anon with joy
receiveth it,
21 Yet hath he not root in
but dureth for a while: for when trib-
ulation or persecution ariseth because
of the word, by and he is offended,
22 He also that received seed
among the thorns is he that heareth
the word and the care of this world,
and the deceitfulness of riches choke
the word, and he becometh unfruitful
23 But he that received seed into
the good ground is he that heareth
the word, and understandeth it,
which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
forth, some a hundredfold, some
sixty, some thirty.
24 ¶ Another parable put be forth
unto them, saying, the kingdom of
heave a is likened unto a man which
sowed good seed in his field,
25 But while men slept, his
enemy came and sowed tares among
the wheat, and went his way,
26 But when the blade was sprung
up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also.
27 So the servants of the house-
holder came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy
field, from whence then hath it tares,
28 He said unto them, An enemy
hath done this. The servants said
unto him, Wilt thou then that we go
and gather them up,
29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye
gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them.

18.所以你哋要聽撒嘅種譬喩呀。
19.但凡聽聞天國嘅道理唔嘵、惡鬼嚟到、奪嘵撒落佢心嘅、呢的就係撒落路邊嘅喇。
20.撒落石地嘅卽係個個聞道、就歡喜接受、
21.但係心內冇根蔃、不過係暫時呮、及至爲道有艱難、或迫害、佢就卽時厭棄。
22.撒落荆棘裏頭嘅、卽係聞道之人、因今世嘅掛慮與及錢財嘅迷感、偪住個的道、就唔結得實。
23.撒落肥地嘅、卽係聞道就曉、亦結實起嚟有百倍、有六十倍有三十倍。〇
24.又設譬喩對衆人話、天國好此人撒好種落佢嘅田、
25.但係當人哋訓着個時、佢仇敵嚟到、撒的稗落穀裏處就去嘵。
26.及至的秧秀茂、而且結成穀、個陣稗亦現出。
27.田主嘅僕、嚟對佢話、主呀、你唔係撒好種喺你田咩、稗喺邊處嚟嘅呢。
28.主對佢哋話、呢的係仇敵做嘅、僕人話、你想我哋去薅嘵佢唔呢。
29.主人話、唔好、慌怕薅個的稗、連埋麥都㧞起嚟、

30 Let both grow together until the
harvest: and in the time of harvest:
I will say to the reapers, Gather ye
together first the tares, and bind
them in bundles to burn them: but
gather the wheat into my barn.
31 ¶ Another parable put he forth
unto there saying, The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard
seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field:
32 Which indeed is the least of all
seeds: but when it is grown, it is the
greatest among herbs, and becometh a
tree, so that the birds of the air come
and lodge in the branches thereof.
33 ¶ Another parable spake he
unto them; The kingdom of heaven
is like unto leaven, which a woman
took, and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.
34 All these things spake Jesus
unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable ftpflske he not unto
them r
35 ' ! 'hat it might be fulfilled whid)
was spoken by the prophet, saying I
will open my mouth in parables) I
will utter things which have been
feept secret from the foundation of the
world.
36 Then Jesus sent the multitude
a.way and went into the house: and
his disciples came unto \nm t saying,
Declare unto 133 the parable of the
tares of the field.
37 He answered and said onto
them, He that soweth tho good seed
is the Son of man;
38「「he fitld is the world; the good
seed are the children of king-
dom; but the tares are the children
of the wicked one;
39 The enemy that so^ed them is
the devil; the harvest is the end of the
work]; and the reap^s ars the angels,
40 AS therefore the tares are
gathered and burned in the fire so
41 shall it; be in the end of this world.

30.由得佢兩樣一齊長大、至到收割、收割個時、我話過收割嘅人知、先揀起的稗、扎埋成把嚟燒佢、獨係收麥入我嘅倉。〇
31.又設譬喩對佢哋話、天國好比一粒芥菜仁、有人*嚟撒落佢嘅田、
32.佢係百樣仁之中至細嘅、及至生長起嚟、大過各樣疏菜而且成爲樹木、至到空中嘅雀鳥、嚟住倒佢的枝處。〇
33.又設譬喩對佢哋話、天國好比麵種、有個女人、擰嚟擠落三斗麵中。致令盡哋發起嚟。
34.呢的咁多、都係耶穌設譬喩講衆人知、若唔係譬喩、就唔同佢哋講。
35.噉就應嘵先知所講嘅話、我將要開口設譬喩、我將要講明自創世以來所隱藏嘅。〇
36.個陣時、耶穌呌衆人散嘵、入去屋裹、佢門生嚟佢處話、田稗嘅譬喩、請解明我哋聽
37.耶穌答佢哋話、撒好種嘅、係人子呀、
38.田係世界、好種係天國嘅子民稗係兇惡嘅子民。
39.仇敵撤稗嘅係魔鬼、収割個時、係世界末日、收割嘅、係天使呀。
40.所好似聚集的稗、俾火嚟燒、在世界末日、亦係瞰樣。


St, MATTHEW XIII
鞏三十第太馬

41 The Son of man shall send
forth his angels, and they shall gather
out of his kingdom all things that
and them which do iniquity,
42 And shall cast them into a
furnace of fire: there shall be wail-
ing and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then shall the righteous shine
forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father. Who hath ears to
hear, let him bear.
44 ¶ Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
field; the which when a man hath
found, he hideth and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath,
and buyeth that field.
45 ¶ Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchantman,
seeking goodly pearls:
46 Who, when he had found one
pearl of great price, went and sold
all that he hath and bought it.
47 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like unto a net, that was cast into
the sea, and gathered of every kind:
48 Which, when it was full, they
drew to shore, and sat down, and
gathered the good into vessels, but
cast the bad away.
49 So shall it be at the end of the
World: the angels shall come forth,
and sever the wicked from among
the just,
50 And shall cast them into the
furnace of fire: there shall be wail-
ing and gnashing of teeth.
51 Jesus saith unto them, Have
ye understood all those things,
They say unto him. Yea, Lord.
52 Then said he saith to them There-
fore every scribe which is instructed
unto the kingdom of heaven, is like
unto a man that is a householder,
which bringeth forth out of his treas-
are things new and old.
53 % And it came to pass, that
when Jesus had finished these para-
bles, he departed thence.

41.人子將要打發佢嘅使者由佢國中、聚集埋所有陷人落罪嘅、與及爲惡嘅人、

53.耶穌講完呢的譬喩、離開個處、

54 And when he was come into
his own country, he taught them in
their synagogue, insomuch that they
were astonished, and said, Whence
hath this man this wisdom, and these
mighty works,
55 is not this the carpenter’s sod,
is not his mother called Mary,
and his brethren, James, and Joseph;
and Simon, and Judas,
56 And his sisters, are they not
all with us, Whence then hath this
man all these things,
57 And they were offended in him.
But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
if, not without honour, gave is his
own country, and in his own house.
58 And he did not many mighty
works there because of their unbelief.
CHAPTER XIV.
1 IN that time Herod the tetrarch
heard of the fame of Jesus,
2 And said unto his servants,
This is John the Baptist, he is
risen from the dead | and therefore
mighty works do shew forth them-
selves in him.
3 ¶ For Herod had laid hold on
John and bound him, and put him
in prison for Herodias' sake, his
brother Philipp wife-
4 For John said unto him, It is
not lawful for thee to have her.
5 And when he would have put
him to deaths he feared the multi-
tude, because they counted him as a
prophet.
6 But when Herod’s birthday was
kept, the daughter of Herodias danced
before them, and pleased Herod.
7 Whereupon he promised with
an oath to give her whatsoever she
would ask.
8 And she, being before instructed
of her mother, said, Give me here
John Baptist's head id sx charger.

第十四章

1.個陣時、分封嘅國王希律、聞得耶穌名聲、

9 And the king was sorry: never-
theless for the oath’s sake, and them
which sat with him at meat, he
commanded it to be given her.
10 And he sent, and beheaded
John in the prison.
11 And his head was brought in a
charger and given to the damsel:
and she brought it to her mother.
12 And his disciples came, and
took up the body, and buried it, and
went and told Jesus.
13 ¶ When Jesus heard of it, he
departed thence by ship into a desert
place apart: and when the people
had heard thereof they followed him
on foot out of the cities.
14 And Jesus went: forth, and saw
a great multitude, and was moved
with compassion toward them, and
he healed their sick.
15 ¶ And when it was evening,
his disciples came to him, saying,
This is a desert place, and the time
h now past; send the multitude
away, that they may go into the
villages, and buy themselves victuals,
16 But Jesus said unto them,
They need not depart; give ye them
to eat,
17 And they my unto him, We
have here but five loaves, and two
fishes,
18 He said, Bring them hither
to me.
19 And he commanded the multi-
tude to sit down on the grass, and took
the five loaves, and the two fishes,
and looking up to heaven, he blessed,
and brake; and gave the loaves to
his disciples, and the disciples to the
multitude.
20 And they did all and were
filled: and they took up of the frag-
ments that remained twelve baskets
full.

15.到挨晚、門生嚟話、呢處係曠野、時候已經過嘵咯、請呌衆人散喇、等佢各去村鄕、爲自己買食物。
16.但耶穌對門生話、佢哋唔使去、你哋俾過佢食囉。
17.門生對佢話、我哋喺呢處、獨有五個餅、兩條魚呮。

40 MATTHEW XIV,
鸾四十第太馬
21 And they that had eaten were
about five thousand men, beside
women and children.
22 ¶ And straightway Jesus con-
strained his disciples to get into a
and to go before him unto the
other side, while he sent the multi-
tudes away,
23 f And when had sent the
multitudes away, he went up into a
mountain apart to pray: and when
the evening was come, he was there
alone.
24 But the ship was now in the s-
midst of the sea, tossed with waves: ^
for the wind was contrary.
25 And in the fourth watch of the
night Jesus went unto them, walking
on the sea.
26 And when the disciples saw
him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, saying, It is a spirit, and
they cried out for fear.
27 But straightway Jesus spake
unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
it is I; be not afraid.
28 And Peter answered him and
said; Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the water.
29 And he said, Come. And when
Peter was come down out of the
ship, he walked on the water, to go
to Jesus.
30 But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid, and begin-
ning to smhe cried, saying, Lord,
save me.
31 And immediately Jesus stretch-
ed forth his band, and caught him,
and said unto him, O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt,
32 And when they were come into
the ship, the wind ceased.
33 Then they that were in the ship
came and worshipped him, saying,
Of a truth thou art the Sou of God,
34 ¶ And when they were gone
over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret,

22.耶穌卽時催門生落船先去對面岸、等自己散嘵衆人。
23.衆人散之後單獨自己上山祈禱、到夜晚、獨剩自己喺處。

25.夜晚四更個時、耶穌行海面、去到佢哋處、
26.門生睇見佢行海面、驚慌話、係怪物呀、噉就慌到呌喊起嚟。
27.耶穌卽時對佢哋話、你哋放心喇係我呮、唔便怕。
28.彼得答佢話、主呀、若係你、就呌我在水面嚟到你處。
29.耶穌話、嚟喇、彼得就喺船落去、行水面埋去耶穌處。
30.但係見風猛、就怕起嚟、將近沉之時、就喓話主呀、救我呀、
31.耶穌卽伸手拉住佢、對佢話、小信嘅人呀、使乜思疑呢。

35 And when the men of that
place had knowledge him, they
sent out into all that country round
about, and brought unto him all that
were diseased;
36 And besought him that they
might only touch the hem of his
garment: and as many as touched
were made perfectly whole.
CHAPTER XV.
1 THEN came to Jesus scribes and
Pharisees, which were of Jeru-
salem sayings
2 Why do thy disciples transgress the
tradition of the elders, for they wash
not their hands when they eat bread.
3 But he answered and said unto
Why do ye also transgress
the commandment of God by your
tradition,
4 For God commanded, sayings
Honour the father and mother: and,
He that curseth father or mother, let
him die the death.
5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say
to his father or his mother, It is a
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
profited by me;
6 And honour not his father or
his mother, he shall be free. Thus
have ye made the commandment of
God of none effect by your tradition.
7 Ye hypocrites well did Esaias
prophesy of you, saying,
8 This people draweth nigh unto
me with their mouth, and honoureth
me with their lips; but their heart is
far from me.
9 But in vain they do worship me,
teaching/or doctrines the command-
ments of men,
10 ¶ And he called the multitude,
and said unto them, Hear and under-
stand:
11 Not that which goeth into the
mouth defileth a man, but that which
cometh out of the mouth, this defileth
a man.

35.個o笪地方嘅人識佢、就使人去到四鄕、將所有病嘅帶嚟佢處。

1.個陣時、有o法唎㘔人、與及讀書人、由耶路撒冷嚟耶穌處、話、
2.做乜你門生犯古人嘅遺傳呢、因爲佢未洗手就食飯呀、
3.耶穌答佢哋話、你做乜將你嘅遺傳、嚟犯神嘅誡命呢。
4.因爲神話、孝敬父母、又話 、毀謗父母嘅、必要定死罪。
5.但係你哋話、人若係對父母話、我所應當敬*你嘅、己經做嘵祭物、
6.就唔使 敬佢父母呀。噉樣、你哋將你嘅遺傳嚟廢嘵神所講嘅咯。
7.僞善嘅人呀、以賽亞預先講及你哋嘅、係着、但話、
8.呢的百姓(扌戒)*嚟恭敬我、但佢個心、離我好遠。
9.佢哋(扌戒)人所吩咐嘅嚟傳敎噉佢拜我係徙然呮。
10.耶穌呌衆人嚟對佢話、你哋要聽、而且要明白呀。
11.唔係入口嘅、噲汚浼人、但係出口嘅、致噲汚浼人呮。

42 MATTHEW XV.
章五十第太渴
12 Then came his disciples and
said unto him, Knewest thou that the
Pharisees were offended, after they
heard this saying?
13 But he answered and said
Every pland which my heavenly
Father hath not planted, shall be
rooted up.
14 Let them alone: they be blind
leaders of the blind. And if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fail
into the ditch.
15 Then answered Peter and said
unto him, Declare unto us this
parable,
10 And Jesus said, Are ye also
yet without understanding,
17 Do not ye yet understand, that
whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
goeth into the belly, and is cast out
into the draught,
18 But those things which proceed
out of the mouth come forth from the
heart; and they defile the man.
19 For out of the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness,
blasphemies:
20 These are the things which defile
a man: but to eat with unwashed
hands defileth not a man.
21 ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and
departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon.
22 And, behold, a woman of
Canaan came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have
mercy on me; o Lord, thou Son of
David; my daughter is grievously
vexed with a devil.
23 But he answered her not a
word. And his disciples came and
besought him saying, Send her away;
for she crieth after us.
24 But he answered and said, I
am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel-
25 Then came she and worshipped
him, saying, Lord help me.

12.於是門生嚟對佢話、o法唎㘔人、聞得呢的說、就厭棄、你知唔知呢。
13.耶穌答話、但凡樹木、唔係我天父種嘅、是必連根蔃.起佢。
14.由得佢喇、佢係盲眼拖人行嘅、若係盲眼拖住盲眼、兩個必定跌若坑處咯。
15.彼得就答佢話、講解呢個譬喩我哋知吖。
16.耶穌話、你哋重未明白咩、
17.豈唔曉凡入口嘅、運化在肚、就遺落厠所咩。
18.但係出口嘅、卽係由心出嚟嘅、個的致噌汚浼人呀。
19.因爲由心出嘅、有惡念、兇殺、姦淫、私通、偸竊、妄證、䙝瀆、
20.呢的係汚浼人o駕、但係未曾洗手嚟食嘅、唔汚浼得人呀。〇
21.耶穌離開個處、去到推羅西頓境界。
22.有一個迦南婦人、由個處境界出嚟、喓話、主呀、大闢子孫、可憐我、我女被鬼害、好辛苦。
23.耶穌一句都唔答門生嚟到求話、使佢去喇、因佢在我哋後便呌喊呀。
24.耶穌答話、我受打發嚟、單係爲以色列家亡失嘅羊呮。
25.婦人嚟拜佢、話、主呀.助我。

St. MATTHEW XV,
26 But he answered and said, It
is not meet to take the childrens'
bread, and to cast it to dogs.
27 And she said, Truth, Lord;
yet the dog, eat of the crumbs
which fall from their masters' table,
28 Then Jesus answered and said
unto her, O woman, great is thy
faith: be it unto thee even as thou
wilt. And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour.
29 And Jesus departed from
thence, and came nigh unto the sea
of Galilee; and went up into a moun-
tain, and sat down there,
30 And great multitudes came unto
him, having with them those that were
lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and
many others, and cast them down at
Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
31 Insomuch that the multitude
wondered when they saw the dumb
to speak, the maimed to be whole,
the lame to walk, and the blind to
see: and they glorified the God of
Israel
32 ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples
unto them, and said, I have compas-
sion on the multitude, because they
continue with me now three days,
and have nothing to eat: and I will
not send them away fasting, lest
they faint in the way,
33 And his disciples say unto him,
Whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness, as to fill so
great a multitude,
34 And Jesus saith unto them,
How many loaves have ye, And
they said, Seven, and a few little
fishes,
35 And he commanded the multi-
tude to sit down on the ground.
36 And he took the seven loaves
and the fishes, and gave thanks and
brake them, and gave to his disciples,
and the disciples to the multitude.

26.但係佢答話、(?械)仔女嘅餅(扌永)過狗食、唔好呀。
27.婦人話、主、係咯徂係狗亦得食佢主人檯下跌落嘅(?咂)碎。
28.於是耶穌答佢話締人呀、你嘅信徳大咯、照依你所願嘅、必做成咯、佢嘅女、自個陣時就好番。〇
29.耶穌又離開個處、嚟到加利利海邊、上山坐處、
30.有(?嘩)衆嚟到佢處、共埋帶住的跛嘅、盲嘅、啞嘅、殘缺嘅、與及各樣病嘅、擠在耶穌脚下、耶穌就醫好佢哋、

32.耶穌呌佢門生嚟話、我可憐呢的衆人、因佢同我喺處、已經三日、如今冇得食、我唔想使佢肚餓番去、怕喺路上**呀、
33.門生對佢話、喺曠野從邊處得咁多餅、致令咁多人食飽呢。
34.耶穌對佢哋話、你有幾多餅呢、佢哋話、七個、兼有幾條細魚。
35.耶穌呌衆人坐落地上、
36.就擰個七個餅、與及的魚、祝謝、擘開俾過門生、門生俾過衆人。

37 And they did all eat, and were
filled: and they took up of broken
meat that was left seven baskets full.
38 And they that did eat were
four thousand men, beside women

39 And he sent away the multi-
tude, and took ship, and came into

CHAPTER XVI,
1 The Pharisees also with the
Sadducees came, and tempting
desired him that he would shew
them a sign from heaven.
2 He answered and said unto them,
When it is evening, ye say, It will
be fair weather: for the sky is red.
3 And in the morning, It will be
foul weather to day: for the sky is red
and lowering. O hypocrites ye can
discern the face of the sky, but can
ye not discern the signs of the times,
4 A wicked and adulterous gener-
ation seeketh after a sign; and there
shall no be given unto it, but
the sign of the prophet Jonas. And
he left them and departed,
5 And when his disciples were
came to other side, they had
forgotten to take bread,
6 ¶ Then Jesus said unto them,
Take heed and beware of the leaven
of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
7 And they reasoned among them-
selves, saying, It is because we have
taken no bread.
8 Which when Jesus perceived, he
said unto them, O ye of little faith,
why reason ye among yourselves,
because ye have brought no bread,
9 Do ye not yet understand,
neither remember the five loaves of
the five thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up,
10 Neither the seven loaves of
the four thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up,

8.耶穌知到、就話、小信嘅呀、因何爲你唔擰餅、就私卟議論呢。
9.你重未省悟咩、唔記得五個餅分過五千人、你執埋幾多籃呢、

11 How in it that ye do not under-
stand that I spake a not to you con-
cerning bread, ye should beware
of the leaven of the Pharisees and
of the Sadducees,
12 Then understood they how that
he ba, as them not beware of the
leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
13 ¶ When came into the
coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked
hi disciples, saying, Whom do men
say that I, the Son of man, am,
14 And they said, Some say that
thou art John the Baptist; some,
Elias; and others Jeremias, or one
of the prophets,
15 He saith unto them; But
whom say ye that I am,
16 And Simon Peter answered
and said, Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God.
17 And Jesus answered and said
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath
not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven.
18 And I say also unto thee, That
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
will build my church; and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it.
19 And I will give unto thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven; and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven;
20 Then charged he his disciples
that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus the Christ.
21  From that time forth began
Jesus to shew unto his disciples  how
that he must go unto Jerusalem and
suffer many things of the elders and
chief priests and scribes, and be killed
and be raised again the third day.
22 Then Peter took him, and began
to rebuke him saying, Be it far from
thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee,

11.我所話你知、要提防o法唎㘔與及o撒吐o該人嘅酵種、唔係爲餅講嘅、你因何唔省悟呢。
12.門生噉致曉得耶穌所講、唔係提防餅嘅酵種、實你o法唎㘔與及o撒吐o該嘅敎訓呀。〇
13.耶穌到該撒利亞腓拉比嘅境界、問門生話、人哋話我人子係乜誰呢。
14.佢哋話有話你係施洗禮嘅約翰有話係以利亞、又有話係耶利米、或先知之中一個、
15.耶穌對佢哋話、但你哋話我係乜誰呢。
16.西門彼得答話、你係基督、永生神之子咯。
17.耶穌答佢話、約拿子西門、你有福咯、因爲指示你唔係有血肉嘅、係我天父呀。
18.我乂對你話、你係彼得、彼得卽磐之請我將建立我敎會喺呢嚿大石上、陰府嘅門、不能勝得佢。
19.我必*天國嘅鎻匙賜過你、但凡你在地上綁住嘅、在天上亦必被綁住、但凡你在地上釋放嘅、在天上亦必被釋放。
20.於是吩咐門生、咪將自己係基督講過人知。〇
21.自此以後、耶穌措示佢門生、自己必往耶路撒冷、多受長老、共衆祭司長、及讀書人嘅苦楚、而且被殺、到第三日復生。
22.彼得就拉埋佢嚟勸諌話、主呀、要愛惜自己呀、願呢的咪累及你。

23 But he turned, and said unto
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
thou art an offence unto me: for
thou savourest not the things that be
of God, but those that be of men.
24 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his
disciples, If man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and take
up his cross, and follow me.
25 For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it: and whosoever will lose
his life for my sake shall find it.
26 For what is a man profited, if
he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul, or what shall a
man give in exchange for his soul,
27 For the Son of man shall come
in the glory of the Father with his
angels; and then he shall regard
every man according to his works.
28 Verily I say unto you. There
be some standing here which shall
not taste of death, till they see the
Son of man coming in his kingdom.
CHAPTER XVII,
1 AND after six days Jesus taketh
Peter, James, and John his
brother, and bringeth them up into
a high mountain apart,
2 And was transfigured before
them: and his face did shine in the
sun, and hif, raiment white as
the light,
3 And, behold, there appeared
unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him.
4 Then answered Peter, and said
unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for in to
be here: if thou wilt, let us make here
three tabernacles; one for thee, and
one for Moses, and one for Elias.
5 While he yet spake, behold, a
bright cloud overshadowed them: and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which
said, This is ray beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased; hear ye him.

23.耶穌回顧對彼得話、撒但、退囉你阻礙我、因爲你唔體貼神嘅情、係體貼人嘅情呮、
24.個陣時、耶穌對佢門生話、但凡想跟從我嘅、必要克勝自己、(貝子)住佢十字架嚟跟從我。
25.因爲但凡想救自己生命嘅、或曰生命當作*魂必定失佢生命、但凡爲我失嘵佢往命嘅、必定揾番佢生命。
26.人若得嘥普天下、而失嘵佢生命、有乜益呢人噲(?械)乜嘢嚟贖番佢生命呢、
27.因爲人子將來乘父嘅榮光、共埋佢嘅聖使降臨、個陴照依各人所做嚟報應佢。
28.我實在話你知、有的企倒呢處嘅、未死之先、必睇見人子喺佢國降臨咯。

第十七章

1.過六日、耶穌帶住彼得雅各與及雅各嘅兄弟約翰、上高山幽靜之處、
2.喺佢哋面前變化、佢面貌光亮、好似熱頭、佢衣服潔白、好似有光。
3.忽 然摩西以利亞現形過佢哋睇嚟共耶穌講。
4.彼得對耶穌話、主呀、我哋喺呢處好咯、你若係肯、我就喺呢處搭三間茅屋、一間爲你、一間爲摩西、一間爲以利亞。
5.佢講緊個時、忽然有光明嘅雲遮住佢哋、而且有聲從雲中處話、呢個係我嘅愛子、我所歡喜嘅你哋要聽佢話。

8 And when they had lifted up
their eyes, they saw no inait, save
Jesus only.
9 And as they came down from

saying, Tell the vision to no man,

10 And his disciples asked him,
saying, Why then my the ecribcs ]

12 Eat I say onto you, that Elias

20 And Jesus said unto them,
Because of your unbelief: for verily
I say unto you, If ye have faith as a
grain of mustard seed ye shall say
unto this mountain Remove hence to
yonder place; and it shall remove:
and nothing shall he impossible unto
you.
21 How be it this kind goeth not
out but by prayer and lasting.
22 ¶ And while they abode in
Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The
Son of man shall be betrayed into
the hands of men:
23 And they shall kill him, and
the third day he shall be raised again.
And they were exceeding sorry.
24 ¶ And when they were come
to Capernaum, they that received
tribute money came to Peter, and
said, Doth not your master pay
tribute,
25 He saith, Yes And when he
was come into the house, Jesus pre-
vented him, saying, what thinkest
thou, Simon, of whom do the kings
of the earth take custom or tribute,
of their own children or of strangers,
26 Peter saith unto him, Of
strangers. Jesus saith unto him,
Then are the children free.
27 Notwithstanding, lest we should
offend them, go thou to the sea, and
cast a hook, and take up the fish
that first cometh up; and when thou
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt
find a piece of money: that take,
and give unto them for me and
thee.
CHAPTER XVIII
1 AT the same time came the dis-
ciples unto Jesus, saying. Who
is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven,
2 And Jesus called a little child
unto him, and set him in the midst

20.耶穌對佢哋話、因你信德少呀、所以我實在話你知、若係有信德、好似芥菜仁噉、卽使對呢個山話由呢處搬去個處、都必搬得、而且你哋冇一件事不能做嘅。
21.倘若唔祈禱禁食、呢的族類唔出去o駕。〇
22.當經遊加利利個時耶穌對門生話、人子要交過人哋嘅手、
23.人哋是必殺佢、第三日必復生、門生噉就好閉翳。〇
24.佢哋入到迦百農、有收丁税嘅人、到彼得處話、你老師納丁税唔納呢。
25.彼得話、係。彼得入屋個時、耶穌先向佢話、西門、你意思點呢、世上各王向乜誰收關餉、或錢糧呢、向自己嘅仔吖抑或向外人呢。
26.彼得話、向外人咯、耶穌話、噉就個的仔可免咯。
27.但係怕佢厭棄我哋。你去喺海處釣魚、將先釣倒個條魚、擘開佢口、必温得銀一塊(?械)嚟替我共你納過佢喇。

St, MATTHEW XVIII.
3 And said, verily I say unto you,
Hxce[)t ye be converted, and become
as little children, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven.
4 Whosoever therefore shall hum-
able hinisei f as this little child, the
same is greatest in the kingdom of
heaven.
5 And whoso shall receive one such
little child in my name receiveth
me.
6 But whoso shall offend one of
these little ones which believe in
me, it were better far him that a
millstone were hauged about his
neck; and that he were drowned
in the depth of the sea.
7 Woe unto the world because
of offences! for it must needs be
that offences come; but woe to that
man by whom the offence cometh!
8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy
foot offend thee, cut them off, and
cast them from thee: it is better for
thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
9 And If thine eye offend
pluck it out and cast it from thee:
it is better for thee to enter into life
with one eye, rather than having two
eyes to be oast into hell fire.
10 Take heed that ye despise not
one of these little ones; for I say
unto you, That in heaven their
angels do always behold the face of
toy Father who is In heaven,
11 For the Son of man is come to
hav that which was lost
12 How think ye, if a isan have
a hundred sheep, and one of them be
gone astra,; doth he not leave the
ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountain9, and seeketh that wlvioh
is gone astray,
13 And if so be that he fhid it,

14 Even so it is not the will

one of these little ones should perish.
15 ¶ Moreover if thy brother shall

ha&t gained thy brother.
16 But if he will not hear thee then
take with thee one or two more, that

17 And he said unto him, Wiiy
cal Lest thou me good, there is none

thou wilt enter into life, keep the

18 He saith unto him. Which,
Jesus saul, Thou shall: do no murder,
Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thea shalt not steals Thou shalt not

All these things have I kept from

hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shfilt have treasure in heaven: and
come and follow me.

that saying, he wmt away sorrowful:
for he had great possessions.

is easier for a camel to go through

^OR the kingdom of heaven is

the morning to lure labourers into
his vineyard.
2 And when he had agreed with
the labourers for a penny a day, be

3 AdcI he went out about the
third hour, and saw others standing
idle in the marketplace,

Call the labourers, and give them

33 Hear another parable; There
was a certain householder which
planted a vineyard, and hedged it
about, and digged a winepress
in it, and built a tower, and let it
out to husbandni^a, and went into a
eomitry:
34 Au, when the time of the fruit
drew he sent his servants to
the husbanden, that they might
receive the fruits of it, "
35 And the husbanden took his
servants, and beat one, and killed
another, and stoned another.
36 Again, he sent other servants
more than the first: and they did
unto them likewise,
37 But last of all he sent unto them
his smi,^ajing, They will reverence
my son.
But when the husbanden saw
the they said among I themselves,
This is the heir; come, let us kill him,
and let us seize on his inheritance,
39 And they caught him and cast
Hm out of the vineyard, and slew
him,
40 When the lord therefore of the
vineyard cometh; what will he do
unto those husbanden,
41 They say unto hm\, He will
miserably destroy those wicked men,
and will let out his vineyard unto
other husbanden which shall render
him the fruits in their seasons,
42 Jesus saith unto them Did ye
never read in the Scriptures The
stone which the builders rejected,
the 舶 me is become the head of the
〒 in:ner: this is the Lord’s doing and
it is marvellous in our eyes,
43 Therefore say I unto you, The
kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and given to a nation bringing
forth the fruits thereof.
44 And whosoever shall fall on
this stone shall be broken: but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
him to powder.

34.將近結果之時、佢打發的㒒人、去耕種人處、收果子。
35.耕種人將佢的㒒人、打一個、殺一個、俾石矴一個。
36.又打發第的㒒人去、多過先時、個的耕種人得佢哋依然如故。
37.在後打發自己仔去佢處、心中話、佢哋是必恭敬我仔咯。
38.個的耕種人見係佢仔、就大家斟酌、話呢個係承受家業嘅仔、我哋嚟殺死佢、噉就奪佢的產業。
39.於是將佢拉出菩提園外殺嘵。
40.園主嚟到之時、點樣處置個的耕種人呢。
41.衆人對佢話、是必剿滅個的惡人、將菩提園柤過別的耕種人、佢必依住時侯納果子過園主咯。
42.耶穌對佢哋話、聖經有寫、師傅所丟棄嘅石、做嘵屋角第一嚿石、呢的係主所做成嘅、在我哋眼中以爲出奇、呢的書你哋未讀過咩。
43.故此我話你知、神嘅國必定向你奪番、賜過個的能結果子嘅百姓咯。

bidden, Behold, I have prepared my

5 But they made light of it, and
went their wys, one to his farm,
another to his mere!iandise:
6 And the reumant took his ser-

and slew them-
7 But when the king heard thereof
he was wrath: and he feent forth
his armies, and destroyed those mur-
derers, and burned up their city,
8 Then saith be to his servants.
The wedding is ready, but they which
were bkldcn were not worthy.
9 Go ye therefore into the high-
way e, and as many as ye shall find,
bid to the marriage.
10 So those servants -went out into
the highways, a m3 gathered together

St. MATTHEW XXII
韋二十二鉛:瑕
68
25 Now there were with in seven
brethren died the first, when he had
married a wife, deceased, and, bar-
ing no issue; left his wife unto his
brother:
26 Likewise the second also, and
the third, unto the seventh.
27 And last of all the woman
died also,
28 Therefore in the resurrection,
whoso wife shall she be of the seven,
for they all had her.
29 Jesus answered and 说 dd unto
them. Ye do err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God.
30 For in the resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of
God in heaven.
31 But as touching the resurrec-
tion of the dead, have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by
God, saying f
32 I am the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living.
33 And when the multitude heard
this, they were astonished at his
doctrine.
34  But when the Pharisees had
heard that he had put the Sadducees
to silence they were gathered together.
35 Then one of them, which was a
lawyer; asked him a question, tempt-
ing him, and saying^
36 Master, which is the great
commandment in the law,
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy might,
38 This is the first and great
commandment.
30 And the second is like unto it,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.
40 On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.

25.我哋之中、有七個兄弟、至大嘅娶親、死嘵、冇仔、剩落個妻過細佬、
26.第二第三至到第七、都係噉樣。
27.收尾個個婦人亦死。
28.噉就到復生之時七個人之中、個婦人做邊個嘅妻呢、因爲個個都娶過佢咯。
29.耶穌答佢哋話、你哋唔曉得聖書、與及神嘅權能、故此錯呀。
30.因爲復生之時、冇娶、冇似神使者喺天上一樣。
31.但係論死者復生、你豈夫曾讀過神曉(言兪)你哋嘅說話咩。
32.話、我係亞佰拉罕嘅神、以撒嘅神、雅各神、神唔係死者嘅神、係生者嘅神。
33.衆人聽聞、就驚奇佢嘅敎訓。〇
34.o法唎㘔人、聞得耶穌今o撒吐o該人冇聲出、就聚集埋。
35.其中有個敎法師試佢問話。
36.老師呀、律法之中、邊條誡係大呢、
37.耶穌對佢話、必要盡你嘅心、盡你嘅性盡你嘅意、愛主卽係你嘅神。
38.呢條誡、係嘅而且第一。
39.第二、亦係噉樣、係要愛你鄰舎好以自己。
40.所有律法、與及衆先知、都係呢兩條誡做領咯。

64 MATTHEW XXIII
41 ¶ While the Pharisees were
gathered together, Jesus asked them,
42 Sayings What think ye of
Christ, whose son is he, They say
unto him, The son of David.
43 He said unto them, How then
doth David in spirit call him Lord,
saying
44 The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit thou on my right hand, till I
make thine enemies thy footstool,
45 ¶ David then call him Lord,
how is he his son,
46 And no man was able to answer
him a word, neither durst any man
from that day forth ask him any
more questions,
CHAPTER XXIII
1 THEN spake Jesus to the multi-
tude, and to his disciples,
2 Sayings The scribes and the
Pharisees sit in Moses 5 seat:
3 All therefore whatsoever they
hid you observe, that observe and do;
hut do not ye after their works:
for they say, and do not.
4 For they bind heavy burdens
and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men’s shoulders; but they
themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers.
5 But all their works they do for
to be seen of men: they make broad
their phylacteries, and enlarge the
borders of their garments,
6 And love the uppermcat rooms
at feasts, and the chief seat, in the
synagogues^
7 And greetings in the markets,
and to t e called of mea, Eabbi, Rabbi.
8 But be not ye called Rabbi:
for one is your Master, men Christ;
and all ye are brethren,
9 And call no fmn your father
upon the earth: for one is your
father, which is in heaven.
Jo Neither be ye called masters:
for one is your Master, even Christ

23 Woe \mio you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe
of mint and anise and cummin, and
have omitted weightier matters of
the law, judgment, mercy and faith:
these ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the other undone.
24 Ye blind guides, which strain
at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
25 Woe unto you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
clean the outside of the cup and of
the platter, but within they are full
of extortion and excess.
26 Thou blind Pharisees cleanse
first that which is within the cup and
platter, that the outside of them
may be clean also.
27 Woe unto you scribes and
Pharisee hypocrites! for ye are
like unto whited sepulchres which
judged appear beautiful outward,
but are within full of dead
bones, and of all unclean 哪,
28 Even so ye also outwardly ap-
pear righteous unto men, hut within
yo are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,
29 Woe unto you scribes and
Pharisees hypocrites! because ye
build the tombs of the prophets t and
garnish the sepulchral of the righteous,
30 And say If we had been in
the days of our fathers, we would
not have been partakers with them
in the blood of the prophets.
31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto
yourselves, that ye are the children
of them which killed the prophets.
32 Fill ye up then the measure of
your fathers,
33 Ye serpents, ye generation of
vipers, how can ye escape the dam-
nation of hell,
34 ¶ Wherefore, behold I send un-
to you prophets, and wise men, and
scribes: and some of them ye shall kill
and crucify; and some of them shall
ye scourge in your synagogues, and
persecute them from city to city:

privately saying, Tell us, when shall
these things be V and what shall he

72 MATTHEW XXI.
13 Wateh therefore; for ye know
neither the day nor the hour wherein
the Son of man cometh.
14 ¶ For the Jeingdm of heaven is
as a man travelling into a far coun-
try, who called his own servants, and
delivered unto them his goods^
15 And unto one he gave five
tulents to another two; and to an-
other one; to every man according to
his several ability; and straightway
took his journey.
16 Then he that had received the
five talents went and traced TYith the
same, and made them other five
talents.
17 And likewise he that had
received two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that had received one
wnt and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord’s money.
19 After a long time the lord of
those servants cometh, and reck on eth
with them,
20 And so he that h^d received
five talents came and brooght other
talents, saying, Lord, thou deh-
veredst unto me fi ve talents: behol<5,
I have gained beside them five
talents more.
21 His lord said unto him, Well
done, thou good and faithful servant:
thou hast been failhful over a few
things, I will make thee ruler over
mimy things: cater ikon into the
jo, of the lord.
22 He also that had received two
talents came and Lord, thou
den veredst unto me two talents;
behold, I have gained two other
talents beside them,
23 Hia lord said unto him, Well
done, good and faithful servant;
thou hast been faithful over a few
things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy
of thy lord.

24 Then he which had received
the one talent came and said, Lord,
I knew thee that thou art a hard
man, reaping where thou hast not
sown, and gathering where thou hast
not strewed:
25 And I was afraid, and went and
hid thy talent in the earth: lo there
thou hast that is thine,
26 His lord answered and said unto
him, Thou wicked and slothful ser-
vand thou knewest that I reap where
I sowed not, and gather where I have
not strewed:
27 Thou oughtest therefore to have
put my money to the exchangers, and
then at my wniing I should have
received mine own with usury.
28 Take therefore the talent from
him, and give it onto him which hath
ten talents,
29 For unto every one that hath
shall be given, and he Bha】l have
abundance: but from him that hath
not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.
30 And cast the unprofitable
servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
31 ¶ When the & ⑽ of man shall
come in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit
upon the throne of his glory:
32 And before him ^ball be gath-
ered all nations: and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd
divideth his sheep from the goats:
33 And he shall set the sheep on
his right hand, but the goats on the
left,
34 Then shall the King say unto
them on his right hand. Come, ye
blessed of my Father inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world:
36 For I was a hungered, and ye
gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and
ye took me in:

24.受一千嘅、嚟到話、主呀、我知你係忍心之人、未撒落個處嘅要收割、未散開個處嘅要收斂、
25.故此我慌起嚟、去藏埋你個千銀喺地、如今得番你嘅原物咯。

27.就應該(扌戒)我嘅銀、擠落找換嘅銀舖、至到我番嚟個時、收得番我嘅本與及利喇。

40 And the King shall answer and
say unto them, Verily I say unto you,

one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto me,
41 Then shall he say also unto
them on the left hand Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,

gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me no drink:
43 I was a stranger, and ye took

39.我哋幾時見你有病、或哋監、嚟探你呢。
40.個王必定答佢哋話、我實在話你知、你爲我呢的一個至細嘅兄弟做過、卽係爲我做過咯。
41.佢又對喺左便嘅話、你受咒詛嘅、離開我入永火囉、係爲魔鬼與及佢使者預僃嘅。
42.因爲我餓、你唔俾我食、我渴、你唔俾我飲、
43.我做遠客、你唔俾我住、我.身、你唔俾我着、我有病、與及喺監處、你唔睇顧我、
44.個陣時、佢哋亦必答佢話、主呀、我哋幾時見你餓、或渴、或做遠客、或.身、或病、或喺監、唔服事你呢。

3 Then asaeraWed together the chief
priests and the scribes, and the elders
of the people, unto the palace of the
high priest, who was called Caiaplias^
4 And consulted that they might
take Jesus by subtllty, and kill him.
5 But they said, not on the feast
day 、 lest there be an uproar among
the people,
6 Now when Jesus was in Beth-
in the house of Sirvion the lepfir,
7 There came unto him a woman
Ivaving an alabaster box of YGry
precious oiniment, and poured it od
his head, as he sat at meat,
8 But when his disciples saw it,
they had  indignation saying, To
what purpose, is this waste,
9 For this ointment might have
been sold for rauch, and given to the
poor. _
10 When Jesus understood it, he
in\d unto them, Why trouble jg the
woman, for she hiith wrought a good
work upoji me.
11 For ye litive the poor always
with you; but me ye have not always.
12 For In that she hath poured
this ointment un my body, she did it
for my burial.
Verily I gay unto yo\\ f Where-
soever this gospel shalt be preached
in the whole world, there shall also
tills, that this woman hath done, be
told for a memorial of her.
14  Then one of the twelve,
called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
chief priests 7
15 And said unto the^a, What will
ye give me, and I will deliver him
unto you, And they covenanted with
him for thirty pieces of silver,
16 And from that time he sought
opportmiity to betray hhn,

18 And he said, Go Into the city
to such a man, and say unto him,
The Master saith, My time is at
hitud; I will keep the passover at
thy house with my disciples,
19 And the disciples did as Jesus
bad appointed them; and they made
ready the passover.
20 Now when the even was come,
he sat down with the twelve.
21 And in they did eat, he said,
Verily i say unto jon f that one of
you shall betray me.
22 And they were exceeding sor-
rowful, and qyqy, one of thorn
to say unto him, Lord, is it I,
23 And he aaswered and said, He
that djppeth his hand with me in the
dbh, the same yhall betray me,
24 The Son of man goeth as it ifl
■written of him: but wot I unto that
man by whom the Son of man is
betrayed ! it had been good for that
in:in if he had not been born.
25 Then Judas, which betrayed
him, aoswCTed and said, Master, is it
I, He said unto him/rhou ha^t said,
26 TT And as they were eating,
Jesus took bread, and blessed and
brake it, and gave it to the discipics,
and said, Take, eat; this is my bocly.
27 And he took the cup, and gave
thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it;
28 For this is my blood of the new
testament, which is shed for many
for the remission of sins,
29 But I unto you, I will not
drink henceforth of this fruit of the
vine, until that day when I drink it
new with you in aiy Eather’s kingdom.
30 And when they bad sung a
hymn, they went out into the montit
of Oliv 四 .
31 Then saith Jesus unto them.
All ye shall be offended because of
me this night: for it is written, I will
eraite the Shepherd, and the sheep of
the flock shall be acattered abroad.

him/riiough all mm shall be offended

34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
unto thee, That this night, before

37 And be took with him Peter
and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
38 Then saith he unto them, My
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
death: tarry ye here, and watch
with me.
39 And he went a little further,
and fell on his faoe, and prayed, say-
ing, o in, Father’ if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me; tieverthe-
less, not as I will, but in thou wilt
40 And he cometh unto the dis-
ciples, and findeth them asleep, and
saith unto Pekr, What could ye not
watch with me one hoar,
41 Watch and pray, that ye enter
not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak.
42 He weiit away again the second
time, and prayed, spying, o my
Father, if this cup may not pass away
from me, except I drink it, thy will
be done.
43 And he came and found them
asleep again; for their eyes were
heavy-

St. MATTHEW XXXII
8 Wherefore that field was called,
The field of blood, unto this day.
9 Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,
saying, And they took the thirty
pieces of silver, the price of him that
was valued, whom they of the chil-
dren of Israel did value;
10 And gave them for the potters
field, as the Lord appointed me,
11 And Jesus stood before the
governor: and the governor asked
him, saying. Art thou the King of the
Jews, And Jesus said unto him,
Thou sayest,
12 And when he was accused of
the chief priests and elders, he
answered nothing,
13 Then said Pilate onto him,
Carest thou not how many things
they witness against thee,
14 And he answered him to never
a word; insomuch that the governor
marvelled greatly.
15 Now at that feast the governor
was wont to release unto the people a
prisoner, whom they would,
16 And they had then a notable
prisoner, called Barabbas.
17 Therefore when they were
gathered together, Pilate said unto
them, Whom will ye that I release
unto you, Barabbas, or Jesus which
is called Christ,
18 For he knew that for envy they
had delivered him,
19 ¶ When he was set down on
the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
him, saying, Have thou nothing to do
with that just man: for I have
suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him.
20 But the chief priests and elders
persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbas; and destroy Jesus.
21 The governor answered and
said unto them, Whether of the
twain will ye that I release unto you,
They said, Barabbas.

11.耶穌企倒總督面前、總督問佢話、你係猶太人嘅王咩、耶穌對佢話、你講得着咯。
12.衆祭司長與及長老吿訟耶穌、耶穌總唔答。
13.彼拉多就對佢話、佢哋(扌戒)咁多事嚟證你、你唔聽聞咩。
14.耶穌一句都唔答佢、故此總督見好出奇。
15.當節期、總督有例要放一個監犯過百姓、任從佢哋所想。
16.個陣時、有一個有名嘅監犯、呌做巴拉巴。
17.佢哋齊集個時、彼拉多問佢哋話、你哋想我放邊個過你呢、巴拉巴抑或耶穌稱爲基督嘅呢。
18.因爲佢知到衆人妒忌嚟解耶穌。
19.總督坐堂個時、佢夫人使人去佢處、話、你唔好辦理呢個義人、因我今日夢中、爲佢好苦切呀。
20.但衆祭司長與及長老、唆聳衆人、求放巴拉巴、殺耶穌。
21.總督答佢哋話、個兩個人、你想我放邊個過你呢。大衆話、巴拉巴咯。

22 Pilate saith unto them, What
will I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ, They all say unto him,
Let him be crucified.
23 And the governor said, Why,
what evil hath he done, But they
cried out the more, saying, Let him
be crucified.
24 ¶ When Pilate saw that he
could prevail nothing, but that rather
a turn ill t was made, he took water,
and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent of
the blood of this just person: see ye
to it.
25 Then answered all the people,
and said, PTIS blood bt on us) and on
our children,
26 ¶ Then released he Barabbas
unto them: and when he had
scourged Jesus, he delivered him to
be enicthed-
27 Then the soldiers of the governor
took Jesus into the common hall, and
gathered unto him the whole band
of mldiers,
28 And they stripped him, and put
on him a scarlet robe.
29 ¶ And when they had platted a
crown of thoros r the put it upon his
head, and a reed in his right hand;
and they bowed the kneo before him,
and mocked h'nn, saying, Hall, King

So And they spit upon him, and
took the reed, and smote him on the
head,
31 And after that they bad mocked
him, they took tlse robe off from him,
and put his ow« raiment on him, and

with vinegar, and put it on a reed,

52 And the graves were opened;

ter his resurrection, and went into the

54 Now when the ocnturion, and

56 Among which was Mary Magda-
lene and Mary the mother of James
and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s

57 When the even was come, there
came a rich man of Arimatliea, named
Josoph, who also himself was J

63 Saying Sir, we remember that
that deceiver said, while he was yet

丄 Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
2 AS it is written in the prophets,
Behold, I send my messenger before
thy fhae, which shall prepare thy
way before thee,
3 The yolce of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare jg the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.
4 John did baptize in the wilder-
ness, and pr^ach the baptism of re™
pentance for the remii^sion of sins.
5 And theio went out unto him
all the laml of Judea, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all baptized of
him in the river of Jordan, conjfessing
their 好 ins.
6 And John was clothed with
capel’s hair, and with a girdle of a
skm about his loins; and he did eat
locusts and wild honey;
7 And preach ed, saying, There
cometh one mightier than X after me,
the latdiet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to stoop down and unloose.
8 I indeed have baptized you with
water: but he shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost.
9 And it came to pass in those
days, that Jesus Game from Nazareth
of Galilee, and \ybe baptized of John
in Jordan,
10 And atmightway coming up out
of the water, he saw the heavens
opened, find the Spirit like a dove
deseeoding upon him:
11 And there came a voice from
heaven saying) Tfion art in, beloved
Son, in whom f am well pleased.

12 And immediately the Spirit
driveth him into the wilderness,
13 And he was there in the iviMer-
ness forty days tempted of Satan;
and was with the wild beasts; and
the angels ministered unto him.
14 Now after that John was put
in prison, Jesus came into
preacbitig the gospel of the kingdom
of God,
15 And saying, The time is faMILed,
and the kingdom of Go(3 is at hand i
repent ye, and believe the gospel#
16 Now as he walked by the sea of
Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew
his brother casting a oet into the sea:
for they were fishers.
17 And Jesus said unto them.
Come ye after me, and I will make
you to become fishers of men.
18 And straightway they forsook
their nets f and ibllowed him.
19 And when he bad gone a little
further theri be saw James the
son of Zeberlee, and John his brother^
who also were in the ship mending
thelr nets,
20 And straightway he called them:
and they left their father Zebedee in
the ship with the hired servants,
and went after him,
21 And they went into Capernaum;
and straightway on the sabbath day
he entereid Into the sjnagogtie, and
taught.
22 And they were astonished at
his doctrine: for he taught them as
one that bad authodtj, and not as
the scribes.
23 And there was is their syna-
gogue a man with an unclean spirit;
and he cried out,
24 Saying, Let us alone; what
h are we to do with thee, thou Jesus
of Kazaroth, art thou come to destroy
us, I know thee who thou art, the
Holy One of God.
25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying,
Hold Lby peace, and come out of him.

26 And when the unclean spirit
had taro him, and cried with a loud

27 And they were all amazed^
insomuch that they questioned among
theinselves, fiaying, What thing is this,

authority ccnmandeth he even the
unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
28 And immediately his fame
spread abroad throughout all the

2 ¶ And forthwith when they were
come out of the synagogue, they en-
tered into the house of Simon and

30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay

33 And all the city was gathered
together at the door.
34 And he healed many that were
sick of divers diseases, and cast out
many deviLS jand suffered not the dev-

6 But there were certain of the
scribes sitting there, and reasoniflg
in their hearts >
7 Why doth this man thus speak
blasphemies, who can forgive sins
but God only,
8 And immediately, when Jesus
perceived in Iris spirit that they so
reasoned wltliin themselves; he isaid,
unto them Why reason ye these
things in your hearts,
9 Whether it easier to say to the
sick of the palsy. Thy sins be for-
given thee; or to say, Arise, and take
up thy bed, and walk,
10 E^t that ye may know that the
Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive slns, (he saith to the sick of
the palsy J
1】 I say unto thee. Arise, and take
up thy beei, and go thy way into
thine house.
12 And immediately he arose, took
up the bed, and went forth before
them all; insomuch that they were
ailamased, and glorified God, saying.
We never saw it on this fashion.
13 And he went forth again by the
sea side; and all the multitude resort-
ed unto him, and he taught them,
14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi.
the 5on of Alplieufs sitting at the receipt
of custom; and said unto him, Follow
me. And he arose and followed him,
15 And it came to pass, that; as
Jesus sat at meat in his house, many
publJean^and sinners sat also together
with Jesus and hm dkciples, for there
were man and they followed him.
16 And wheti the scribes and
Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
and smners, they said unto Ida dis-
ciples, How is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans And sinners,
17 When Je.sus heard il, he Baith
unto them, They that fire whole have
no need of the physician, but they
that are sick: I came not to call the

18 And the disciples of Jnhn and
of the Pharisees used to fast: and
they come and say unto him, Why
do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisecs fa^t but thy disciples fast
not,
19 And Jesus said unto them, Can
the children of the bridechamber fast,
while the bridegroom is with them,
as long as they have the bridegroom
with them 5 they cannot fast.
20 But the days will come, when
the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then ^hall they fast
in those days.
21 No man also seweth a piece of
new cloth on an old garment; else
the new piece that filled it up taketh
away from the old, and the rent is
made worse.
22 And do mati putteth new wine
into old bottles; else the new wine
doth burst the bottles, and the wine
b spilled, and the bottles tviH be
marred: but new wine must be put
into new bottks.
23 And it came to paa% that he
went through the com fields on the
sabbath day; and !tis discipi os began 3
as they went, to pluck the ears
of corn.
24 And the Pharisees Bai unto
him, Behold, why do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful,
25 And he said unto them Have
ye never read what David did, when
he had need, and was a hungered^
he, and they that were with him,
26 How he went into the house of
God in the days of Abiathar the high
priest, and did eat the shewbread,
which is not lawful to eat but for the
priests, and gave also to them which
were with him,
27 And he said unto them. The
sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the sabbath:
28 Therefore the Son of man is
Lord also of the sabbath.

1 AND he entered agtiia into the
Xi synagogue; and there was a
man there which had a withered hand.
2 And they watched him, whether
he would heal him on the sabbath
day; that they might accuse him.
3 A ad he saith unto the man which
had the withered hand, Stand forth,
4 And he saith unto them, is it
lawful to do good on the sabbath
days, or to do evil, to eave life, or to
kill, But they held their peace,
5 And when he had looked round
about on them with anger, bein^
grieved for the hardness of their
fiearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch
forth thi ne Tband. And he stretched
it out; and his hand was restored
whole as the other.
6 And the Pharisees went forth,
and straightway took counsel with
the Herod rails against him, how they
might destroy him.
7 But Jesus withdrew himself with
his disciples to the sea: and a great
multitude from Galilee followed him,
and from Judea)
8 And from Jerusalem, and from
Idumea, and/j, one beyond Jordan; and
they about Tyre and Sidon a great
multitude, when they had heard what
great things he did/mine unto him,
9 And he spake to his disciples,
that a small ship should wait on him
because of the multitvide, lest they
aliQuk] throng him.
10 For he had healed many; inso-
imich that they pressed upon"him for
to touch him, as man, as had plagues.
11 And uticlean spirits, when they
saw him, 户 11 down before him, and
cried, saying, ^'lion art the Son of God.
12 And he straitly, charged them
that they should not make him known,
13 And he goeth up Into a raoua-

would: and they came unto him.

6 But when he saw Jesus afer off,
he ran and worshipped him,
7 And cried with a loud voice’ and
said, What have I to do with tlxee,
Jesus, thou Son of the moet high
God, I adjure thee by God, that
thou tomient me not.
8 (For he said unto him; Come
out of the maxi, thou uueleaii spirit.)
9 And he asked him, What is thy
iiRme, And he answered, saying,
My name is Legion; for we are
man)'
10 And he besought him much
that he woukl not send them away
oot of the country.
11 Nou ilsere was there nigh unto
the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding,
12 And all the devils besought
him, eaving, Send us into the swine,
that we may enter into them,
13 And forth with Jesus gave them
leave. And the mickan spirits went
out, fliid catered into the swine, and
the herd ran violently down a steep
place mto the sea, (they were about
two Umusand,）and were choked iti
the s&a,
14 And they that fed the swine
fled, and told it in the city, and in
the country. And they went out to
see what it was that was done,
15 And they cotoe to Jesus, and
see hiDi that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting,
and clothed, and in his right mind;
and they were afraid.
16 And they that saw it told them
how it befell to him that was
poastssed with the devil, and also
concerning the swine.
17 And thov began to pray him to
depart out of their coasts.
18 And whim he was come into
the ship, he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he
might be with hiru.

5 AndbeoouM there do no mighty
work, save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
6 And he marvelled because of
their unbelief. And fee went round
about the viUnges, teaching,

twelve and began to send them
forth by two and two; and gave them
power over unclean spirits;
8 And commanded them that they
should take nothing for their journey^
eave a staff' only; no scrip, no bread^
no money in their parse:
9 But be shod with sandals > and
not pot on two coats.
10 And he said unto them. In what
place soever ye enter into a hDase,
there abide till ye depart from that
place.
11 And whosoever shall not re-
ceive you, nor hear you, when ye
depart thence, shake off the dust

It shall be more tolerable for Sodom

6 He answered and said unto

of you hypocrite as it is written,
This people honoureth me with their
lips, but their heart is far from me,
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship
me, teaching for doctrines the eom-
nmmlmej^its of men,
8 For laying aside the command-
meet of God, jq hold the tradition
of men, as the washing of pots and
cups: and many other mch like
things ye do.
9 And he said unto them, Full
well ye reject the commandment of
God, that ye may keep your own
tradition-
10 For Moses said, Honour thy
father and thy mother; an el. Whoso
cureeth father or mother, let him die
the death:
11 But ye say, If a man shall say
to his father or mother It is Corbari,
that is to a giilt, by whatsoever
thou mighlest he profited by me;
he 老 halb be fr^e.
12 And ye suffer him no more
to do might for his father or ibis
mother;
13 Making the word of God of none

18 And he saith unto them. Are
ye so without understanding also,
']h ye not perceive, that whatsoever
thing from without entereth into the
man, it cannot defile him,
19 Because it entereth not into
his I wart, but into the belly, and
goeth out into the diaught, purging
all meats,
20 And he said, That which cometh
out of the man, that defileth the man,
21 For from within, out of the
heart of mm, prooeed evil thoughts,
adulteries, forrucations, murders,
22 Thefb, covetousness, wicked-
ness, deceit, lasciviousness all evil
eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
23 All these evil things come from
within, and defile the man.
24 1' And from thence he arose;
and went into the borders of Tyre
and Sidon, and entered into a house,
and would have no man know it • but
he could not be hid.
25 For a cetiain woman; whose
young daughter had an unclean
spirit, hoard of him, and came and
fell at his feet:
26 The woman was a Greek, a
Syrophenieian by nation  and she
besought him that he would cast
forth the devil out of her daughter.
27 But Jesus said unto her, Let
the children first be filled: for it 13
not meet to take the children^
bread, and to cast it mUo the clogs.
28 And she answered and said unto
him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs tinder
the table eat of the children crmnbs.
29 And he said unto her, For this
fsaying go thy way  the devil is gone
out of thy daughter,
30 And when she was come to her
hotise, she found the devil gone out,
and her daughter laid upon the bed.
31 And again, departing from

him to put his hand upon him.
33 And he took him aside from
the multitude, and put his ixngera
into Ids ears, and he spit, and touched
his tongue;
34 And Icoking op to heaven, he
sighed and saith unto him, Eph-
phatha, that is, Be opened»
36 And straightway his ears were
opened, and the string of his tongue
was loosedy and he spake plain,
36 And he charged them that they
should tell no man: but the more
he charged them, so much the more
a great deal they published it;
37 And were beyond measure
astonished, saying. He hath done all
things well i he maketh both the
deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

43 And if thy hand offimd thee,
cut it off: it is better for thee to
cuter into life maimed, than having
two Imadg to go into hell into the
fire that never shall be quenched s
44 Where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched.
45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut
it off: it is better for thee to enter
halt into life, than having two feet
to be east Into heH, Into the fire that
never shall be quenched:
46 Where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched.
47 And if thine eye offend thee y
pluck it out: it is better for Ihee to
enter into the kingdom of God with
ono eye, than having two eyes to be
cast into hell fire:
48 Where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not qticnehed.
4 ¶ For every one shall be salted
with fire, and every sacrifice shall
be salted with salt.
50 Salt is good; but if the salt have
lost his sflltneas, wherewith will ye
season it, Have salt in yourselves,
and have peace one with another.

22 And he was sad at that sayings
and went away grieved: for he had

24 And the disciples were aatonished

again, and saith unto them, Clulclren,
how hard is it for them that trust in

God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, thevm for
a rich man to enter into the kingdom

26 And they were astonished out
of measure, saying among themsdves,
"Who then can be saved,

3 And if any man say unto you,
Why clo ye this, any ye that the

4 And they went their way, and
found the colt tied by the cloor with-
out in a place where two ways met,
and they loose him,
5 And certain of them that stood
there said unto them. What do ye,
loosing the colt,
6 And they said unto them even
r.s Jesus had commanded: and they
let them go.
7 And they brought the colt to
Jesus, and out their garments on
him, and he sat upon him.
8 And many spread their garments
in the >way; and others cut down
branches off the trees, and strewed
them in the way.
9 And they that went before, and

If a man’s brother diey, and leave his

died, neither left he an, seed: and

the dead, they neither marry, nor are
given in marriage; but are as the

as thyself. There is none other com-
mandment greater than these.
32 And the scribe said unto him^
Wei], Master, thou hast ^aid the
truth: ior there is one God; and
there is none other but he:
33 And to love him with all tibe
heart, and with all the underst anding,
and with all thesoul, and with all the
Streugth, and to love his neighbour
as ]nm=Glf', is more than all whole
burnt offerings and sacrifices.
34 And when Jesus saw that he
answered discreetly, be said unto him,
Thou art not fdr from the kingdom
of God, And no man after that durst
aslc him am, question,
35 ¶ And Jesus am we red and said,

3 And the ckief priests accused
him of many things; but he atiswered
nothing-

saying, Ausvyerest thou uothing,

against thee.
5 But Jesus jet answered nothings
so that Pilate marvelled.

unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
they desircdL

that had made Insurrection with birn 3
who bad committed murder in the

began to desire him to do aa he had
ever done unto them,

ing, Will ye that I release unto you
the Ring of the Jews,
Jo For he knew that the chief
priests ]iad delivered him for envy.
11 But the chief priests moved
the peo^le, that he should rather
release Barabbas unto them,

a declaration of those thiags which
are most surely believed among us,
2 Even in they delivered them
unto us, wtrich from the beginning
were eyewitnesses, and ministers of
the word;
3 It seemed good to me also;
Laving had perfect understanding of
ull things from the very first, to wri te
tin to thee in order, most excellent
Theoplulus,
4 That thou mightest know the
certainty of those things wherein
thou hast been instructed,
5 THERE was In the days of
Hero the king of Judea,
a certain priest natiled Zacbarlas; of
the course of Abia: and his wife tms
of the ciaughters of Aaron, and her
name was Elisabeth,
6 And they were both rightcoua
before God, walking in all the com-
mamlments and ordinances of the
Lord blameless,
7 And they had no child, becausa
that Elizabeth was barren w, and they
both were now well stricken in years,
8 And it came to pass, that, while
he executed the priest's office before
God in the order of his course, \
9 According to the custom of the
priest’s office, his lot w^s to burn
incense when he went iDto the temple
of the Lord.
10 And the whole mukitiule of the
people were praying without at the
time of incense.

St, LUKE, I,
11 And there Appeared unto him
an angel of the Lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense.
12 And when Zacliaiias saw him:he
way troubled, and fear fell upon him,
13 But the angel said unto him,
Fear not, Zaelmrias: for thy prayer
is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth
slidl bear thee a son, and thou shalt
call his name John,
14 And thou shalt have joy and
gladness; and many shall rejoice at
his birth.
15 For he shall be great in the
slght of the Lrord, and shall drink
neither wine iior strong drink; and
he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost^
even from his mother wotab,
16 And many of the children of
Israel he turn to the Lord
their God.
17 And be shall go before him in
the spirit suul power of Elias to turn
the hearts of the fathers to the
childxeo, and the disobedient to the
wisdom of the jest; to make ready
a people prepared for the Lord.
18 Aiui Zacharies said unto the
angel, 'Whereby shall I know this,
for I am nn old man, and my wife
well stricken in years.
10 And the angel answering said
unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
in the presence of God; and am sent
to speak unto thee, and to shew thee
these glad tidings.
20 And, behold, thou shalt d umb,
and not able to speak, until the day
that these things shall be performed,
because thou belie vest not my words,
which shall be fulfilled in their season,
21 And the people waited for
Zacharias, and roar veiled that he
tarried so long in the temple.
22 And when he came o\it f he
could not speak unto them: and they
perceived that he had seen a vision
in the temple; for he beckoned unto
them, and remained speechless.

were accomplished, he departed to
his own house.
24 And after those days his wife
Elisabeth ccncoived, and hid herself
five luontlis, saying
25 Tlius liafiK ths Lord dealt with
me in the days whereia he looked
oq me, to take awa, my reproach
among men,
26 And in the sixth month the
angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
a city of Galilee, named Nazareth^
27 To a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Jeseph of the
house of David  and the virgin's
naipe was Mary.
28 And the angel came in unto her^
a"d 纽 id, Hail, thou that art highly
favoured, the Lord is with thee:
blessed art thou among women.
29 And when she saw him she
ypas troubled at his saying, and cast
in her mind what maimer of saluta-
tion this should be.
30 And the angel said unto iier,
Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
favour with God.
31 And, behold, thou shalt con-
ceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
soty, and shalt call his name JESUS.
32 He shall be great, and shall be
called the Son of the Highest; and
the Lord God shall give unto him the
throne of his father David:
33 And he shall rejgn over the
h,use of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no end.
34 Then said Mary unto the angel,
How shall this be, seeing I know
not a raau,
And tangel answered and
said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
come upon them, and the power of ths
Highest shall overshadow thee:
therefore also that holy thing which
shall be born of thee shall be called
the Son of God.

36 And, behold thy cousin Elb-
abet.h, she hath also conceived a son
in her old age, and this is the sixth
month with her, who was called
barren.
37 For with God nothing shall be
impossible.
38 And Mary said, Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
according to thy word. And the angel
departed from her.
39 And Mary arose in those days,
and went into the hill country with
haste, into a cit, of Juda;
40 And entered into the house of
Zaeliarias, and saluted EIiBabeth,
41 And it came to pass, when
Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Ma; ry, the babe leaped in her womb;
and Elisabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost:
42 And she spake out with a loud
voice; and said, Elessed art thou
among women, and blessed is the
fmit of thy womb.
43 And wheuce is this to me 9 that
the mother of my Lord should come
to me,
44 For, lo, soon as the voice of
thy salutation souiided in mine ears,
the babe leaped in my womb for jay.
45 And bkssed is she that believed:
for there shall be a performance of
those things which were told her
from the Lord,
46 A tad Mary said, My soul doth
magnify the Lord,
47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in
God my Saviour.
48 For he hath regarded the low
estate of his handmaiden: for, behok],
from henceforth all generations abal!

2 And saw two ships standing by
the lake: but the  slier men were
gone out of them, and were washing

3 And he entered into one of the
ships, which was Simony and prayed
him that he would thrust out a little
from the land. And he sat down,
and taught the people out of the ship,
4 Now when he had left speaking,
he said unto Simon, Laimch out into
the deep, and let down your nets
for a draught.
5 And Simon aiiswering said unto
luei, Master’ we have toiled all the
night, and have taken nothing:
nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net.
6 And when they this done,
they inclosed a great multitude of
fishes: and their net bruke.
7 And they beckoned unto their
partners which wera in the other
ship, that they should come and help
them, And they came, and filled both
the ship:y, so that they bogan to sink.

unto them; No man putteth a piece
of a new garment an old; if
otherwise, then both the new maketh
a rent, and the piece that was taken
out of the new agreeth not with the

37 And no man putteth new wine

will burst the bottles, and be spilled,

41 There was a certain ered I tor
which had two debtors: the one owed
five and the other fifty.
42 And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly forgave them both.
Tell me therefore, wl iich of them will
love him most,
43 Simon answered and I
suppose that he, to whom he forgave
most. And he said unto him, Thou
hast rightly jodgec].
44 And he turned to the wonmn^
and said unto Siinot Seest thou this
Woman, I entered into ihlnc himsq
thou gavest me no water for my feet:
but shG ha ill washed my feet with
tears, and wiped them with the hairs

45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but
this woman, since the time I came
in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
46 My head with oil thou didst
not anoint; but this woman hath
anointed my feet with ointment
47 W he reform I sny unto thee,
Her sius, wlnch are many, are for-

3 And Joanna the wife of Ohuza
Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and
many others, wMch raimistered unto
him of their substance.
4 ¶ And when nmch people were
gathered together, and were come to
him out of every city, he spake by a
parable:
5 A sower went out to fow his seed:
and as he sowed, some fell by the
way side, and it was trodden down,
and the fowls of the air devoured it.
0 And some fell upon a rock; and bs
boou as it was sprung tip, it withered
away, because It lacked moisture.
7 And some fell among thorns;
and tlse thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it.
8 And other fell on good ground,
and sprang up, and bare fruit a hun-
dredfold. And when he bad said
these thingg, he cried; He that hath
ears to henr, let him hear.
9 And his thsclpks asked him,
saying, IfVIIat might this parable be,
10 And he said, Unto you it is given
to know the mysteries of the kingdom
of God; but to others in panibles;
that seeing they might not see, and
hearing they might not understand.
11 Now the parable is this: The
seed is the word of God.
12 Those by the way side are they
that ]iear; then ecmeth the devil,
and taketh away the word out of
their hearts’ lest they should believe
ftiid be saved.
13 They on the rock are (key 、
袖油, when they hear, receive the
word with joy; and these have no
root, which for a while belieand
in time of temptation fall away.
14 And that which fell among
thorns are they, which, when they
have heard, go forth, aqd are choked
■with cares and riches and pleasures
of this life, and bring no fruit to
perfection.

not come at him for the press.
20 And it was told him by certain
which said, Tliy mother and thy

21 And he answered unto
them. My mother raid my brethren

God, and do it.
22 ¶ How it came to pass on a cer-
tain day, that he went into a ship with
his disciples: and he said unto them.
Let us go over unto the other side of
the lake. And they launched forth,
23 But as they sailed, he fell asleep:
and there came down a storm of wind
on the lake; and they were filled
with water, and were in jeopardy.
24 And they came to him 5 and
awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we
perish. Then ha arose and rebuked
tht wind and the raging of the water:
and they amsed, and there was a cnlm.
25 And he said untft them, Where

wontlered, stiying ono to another,
"What manner of man is this! for
he commandeth even the winds and

26 ¶ And they arrived nt the
country of the Gat1arenca, which is
over against Galilee.
27 And when he went forth to
Iand; there met him out of the city a
certain man which had devils long
tiino, and ware in> c!othes, neither
abode in any house, but in the
tombs- I
28 When iie saw Jesus, he cried
out, and fell down before him, and
with a loud voice said, What tmve X
to clo with thee, Jesus, thou Son of
God most high, I beseech thee,
torment me not,
29 (For he had commanded the
unclean spirit to come out of the man.
For oftentimes it had caught him:
and he was kept bound with chains
and is fetters; and he brake the
bands, and was driven of the devil
into the wilderness.)
30 And Jesus asked him, saying,
What is thy name, And he said,
Legion: because many devils were
entered into him.
31 And they besought him that he
would not command them to go out
into the tk^p.
32 And there was there a herd of
many swine feeding on the mountain:
they besought him that he would
suffer them to enter into them. And
he suffered them,
33 Then went the devils out of the
man, and entered into the swine:
and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the lake, and were
choked.
34 When they that fed Oiem saw
what was done, they flGt], ftiid went
and told it In the city and h\ tlxe
country.
35 I'hen they went out to sfie what

36 They also which saw it t«ld
them by what means he that was
possessed of die devils was healed,
37 ¶ Then the whole multitude of
the cotmtry of the Gadarenos round
ixhout besought him to cltiparf; from
them; for they were taken with great
four: and he went up into the ship^
and returned back again,
38 Now tin) iv.un, tRit of whom the
devils were dqmrkd besought him
that he might be with him: but Jesus
sent him away; saying,
39 Return to thine own house, and
shew how great things God hath done
unto thee. And he went his way,
and published throughout the whole
city Itow great th tugs Jesus had done
unto bio].
40 And it came to pass, that when
Jesus was returned, the jiaoiAegladly
received him: for they were all wait-
ing for him.
41 ¶ And, behold, there came a
man named Jaims, and he was a
ruler of the synagogue; and !te fell
down at Jesus feet, and besought him
that he would come into lais house:
42 For he had one only daughter,
twelve, r ears of age, and
lay a dying. But as he went the
peo|>le theoiiged him.
43 And a woman having an
issue of blood twelve yoars which
spent all ]ter living upon physiclnns^
neither could be healof iniy;
44 Came behind him t and touched

6 And they departed and went
through the towns, preadnng the
gospel, and healing every where.
7 If ITow Herod the tetrarch heard
of all that was done by him: and he
was pcrplezed, because that it was
said of some, that John was risen
from the dead;
8 And of some, that Elias had
appeared; and of others, that one of
the old prophets was risen agam.
9 And he rod said, John have I
beheaded; but who is this, of whom
I Lear such things, And he desired

10 ¶ And the apostks, when they
were returned, told him all that they
had done. And he took them, and
went aside privately into a desert
place belonging to the city called
Bethsaida,
11 And the people, when they
knew it, followed him: and he receiv-
ed them, and spake unto them of the
kingdom of God, and healed them
that had neeti of henling.
12 And when the day began to

32 The men of Nineveh shall rise
up in the judgment with this genera-
tion; and shall condemn. It: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas
is here,
33 Ko man, when he hath lighted
a candle putteth u in a secret place;
neither under a bushel, but on a
candlesticlc, that they which come in
may see the light.
34 The light of the body is the
eye: therefore when thine eye is
thy whole bcjdy also is full of
light; but when thine eye is evil, the
body also u full of darkness.
35 Tako heed therefore, that the
light wliloii is in thee be not tlarkness,
36 If thy whole body therefore be
full of light, having no part dark, the
whole shall be full of light, as when
the bright shining of a candle doth
give thee light
37 ¶ And as he spake, a certain
Pharisee besought him to dine with
him: and he went in, and sat down

38 And when the Pharisee saw

39 And the Lord said unto Jnm,
Now do ye Pharisees make clenn the

ing and wickedness,
40 Ye fools, did not he, that msidc

43 Woe unto you, Fliarisees l for

47 ^Voe unto you ! for yo build the

48 Truly ye bear witness that ye
allow the deeds of your fathers: for
they indeed killed them and ye build

49 Therefore also said the wisdom
of God, I will send them prophets

shall slay and persecute:
50 That the blood of all the proph-

51 From the blood of Abel unto
the blood of Zucbarms, which perished
between the altar and the temple:
verily I say un to you, If; shall be
required of this generation.
52 Woe jmto you, lawyers! for ye
have taken away the key of know-
ledge: ye entered not in yourselves,
and thorn that were entering in ye
hindered .
53 And as he said these thiuge onto

b^gan to urge him vdiemently, and to
provoke him to speak of many things:

himself shall be exalted.

with me; for I have found a^y sheep
which was lost.
7 I say unto you, that likewise joy
shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth more than over ninety

repentance.
8 ¶ Either what woman having ten
pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
doth not light a candle, and sweep
the house and seek diligent till she
find
9 And when she hath found it, she
calleth her friends and her neighbours
together, saying, Rejoice with me;
for I have found the piece which I
had lost.
10 Likewise, I say unto you there
is joy in the presence of the angels of
God over one sinner that repenteth.
11 And he said, A certain man
had two sons:
12 And the younger of l]x, in said
to his father. Father, give me the
portion of goods that faHHh to me.
And he divided unto them his living.
13 And not many days after the
younger son gathered all together
and took his journey into a far coun-
try I and there wasted his substance
with riotous living.
14 And when he had spent all,
there arose a mighty famine in that
land; and he begiui to be in want.
15 And he went and joined himself
to a cilisjen of that country; and he
sent him into his fields to feed swine.
16 And he would fain have filled
his belly with the husks that the
swine did eats and no man gave unto
him,

he that is unjust in the least is
unjust also in much.
11 If therefore ye have not bem

member that thou in thy lifetime
receivcdst thy goad things and like-
wise Lazarus evil thing 行 i but now he
is comforted, and thou art tormented,
26 And beside all this, between us
and you there is a great gulf fixed:
so that they which would from

they pass to us, that would come from
thence,
27 Then be said, I pray thee there-

1 THEN said he unto the disciples,
It is impossible but that offences
will come: but woe unto him, through
whom they come.
2 It were better for him that &
millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he cast into the sea, than that
he should offend one of these little
ones.
3 If Take heed to yourselves; If
thy brother trespass against tlbee,
rebuke him; and if he repent) forgi ve
him,
4 And if he trespass against thee
seven times iix a day; and seven
times in a day turn again to thee, say-
ing, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
5 And the apostles said unto the
Lord, Increase our faith.
6 And the Lord ^aid, If ye had
faith as a grain, of mustard seed, ye
might say unto this ejeamme tree,
Be thou plucked op by the roo and
be thou planted in the sea; and it
should obey you,
7 But which of you having a ser-
vant ploughing or feeding cuttle will
unto him by and by when he is
come from the field. Go and sit down
to meat,
8 And will not rather say unto him.
Make ready wherewith I may sup,
and gird thyself, stnd serve me, till I
ha;ve eaten and drunken; and after-
Vk'are thou shalt eat and drink,
9 Doth he thank that servant
becauee he did the things that were
commanded him, I trow not
10 So likewise ye, when ye shall
have clone all those things which are
commanded you, say, We are improfit-
able servants: we have done that
which was our duty to clo.
11 I| And it came to pass, as he went
to Jerusalem that he passed through

12 And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that
were lepers, which stood afar off:
13 And they lifted up their voices,
and sEtul, Jesus Master, have racrcy

14 And when he saw them, he said
unto them, Go shew yourselves onto !
the priests And it came to pass’ that,
as they went, they were cleansed.:
15 And one of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned hack, and
mth a loud voice glorified God, i
16 And fell down on his face at |
his feet, giving him thanks: and be
was a Samaritan.
17 And Jesus answering sald Were
there not ten cleansed, but where
are the nine,
18 There are not found that re-
turned to give glory to God, save this
stranger.
19 And he said unto him. Arise,
go thy way: thy faith hath made

of the rimrisees, when the kingdom
of God should come, he answered
them and said, The kingdom of God
cometh not with observation:

26 And as it was in the days of
Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
the Son of man,
27 They did eat, they drank, they
married wives, they were given in
maniage, until the day that Noe en-
tered into the ark, and the flood
came, and destroyed them all.
28 Likewise also as it was in the
days of Lot; they did eat 5 they drank,
they bought, they sold, they planted,
they builded;
29 But the same day that Lot went
out of Sodom it rained fire and brim-
stone from heaven, and destroyed
them all,
So Even thus shall it be in the day
when the Son of man is revealed.
31 In that dny, he which shall be
upon the housetop, and his stuff in
the house let him not come down to
take it away: and he that is 玉 a the
field, let him likewise nat return back,
32 Ueniember Lot’s wife.
33 Whosoever shall seek to save
his life shall lose it; and whosoever
shall lose his life shall preserve it
34 I tell you, is that night there
s,hall be two men in one bed; the
one shall be taken, and the other
shall be kit,
35 Two women shall ha griiKling
together; the one shall be taken, end
the other left.
36 Twommsball be in the hekI; the
one shall be taken; and the othc,r left.
37 And they answered and said
unto him, A¥here, Lord, And he
said unto them, Wher^;oever the
body is, thither will the eflgless be
gathered together.

8 I tell you that he will avenge

certain which trusted in themselves

10 Two man went up into the
temple to pray; the one a Pharisee^
and the otSier a publican»
11 The Pharisee stood and prayed
tlms with himself; God, I thank thee,
that I am not as other men are f
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
even as this publicaii,
12 工 fast twiec in the week, I give
tithes of all that I ]Possess,
13 And the publican, standing afar
ofT, would not lift up so much as kts
eyes unto heaven, but smote upon \in
breast, saying God be meroiful to me
a sinner,
14 I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than the
other: for every one that exalteth
him 册 If shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted.
15 And they brougKt unto him

31 And if any man ask you, Why

32 And they that were sent went
their way and found even as he had

!Neither tell I you by what authority

9 Then began be to speak to the
people this parable; A certain man
planted a vineyard, and let it forth
to liusbandmen, and went into a far
country for a long time,
10 And at the season he sent a
servant to the husbandeD, that they
should give him of the fruit of the
vineyard: but the liusbandmen beat
him, and eeut him away empty,
11 And again he seat another ser-
vand and they beat him also, and
entreated him shamefully and sent
him away empty,
12 And again he sent a third: and
they wounded him also, and east him
out.
13 Then said the lord of the vine-
yard, What shall I day I will send
my beloved son; it may be they will
reverence hi 怖 when they see him.
14 Eat when the husbanden saw
him, they reasoned among themselvf]s,
saying, Thia is the heir: come, let
in Mil him, that the iaheritancc may
be ours,
15 So they cast him out of the vine-
yard, and killed him. What there-
fore shall the lord of the vineyard do
unto them,
16 He shall come and destroy these
husband men, and shall give the vine-
yard to others. And tv lien they beard
it y they said, God forbid.
17 And he beheld them, and said,
What is this then that is written,
The stone which the builders rejected,
the same is become the head of the
corner,
18 Whosoever shall fall upon that
stone shall be broken; but on whom-
soever it shall fall, it will grind him

2 And he saw also a certain poor
widow casting in thither two niit^8.
3 And be said, Of a truth I say
unto you, that this poor wi(low hath

4 For all these have of their
abundance cast in unto the offings
of God: but she of hev penury hath
cast in all the living that she had.
5 ¶ And in some spake of the

Master, but when shall these things
be, and what sign will there be when
these things shall come to pass,
8 And be said, Take lieed that jo

in my name, saying, I am Christ;
and the time draweth near: go ye
not therefore after them,
9 But when ye shall hear of wars
and commotions, be not terrified: for
these things must first come to piss;
but the end is not by and by,
10 Then said he unto t\\em, Nation

belonged unto Heroes junscliction,
he sent him to Herod, who himself
also was at Jerusalem at that time.

he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season,
because he had lizard many things
of him  and he iioped to have scon
some miracle done by him-

remember how he spake unto you
when he was yet in Galilee,
7 Saying, The Sod of man must
be delivered into the hands of sinfnl
men, and be crucified, and the third

8 AlkI tlIey remembered his words,
9 And returned from the sqmu

10 It was Mary Magdalene, and
Joanna, and Mary the mother of

themselves, and departed, wondering
in Idraself at that which was come

13 ¶ And, behold; two of them
went that same day to a village called
Era mans, which was from Jerusalem
about threeseoro furlongs.
14 And they talked together of all
the things which and happened.
15 And it came to pass, that, while
they communed together and rea-
soned, Jesas Itimse/f I drew near, and
went ^ith them.
16 But their eyes were hoklen that
they should not know him.
17 And he said unto them, What
manner of communications are these
that ye Ijuto one to another, as ye
walk, and are sad,
18 And the one of them wbase
name was Cleopas, answering said
unto him, Art thou only a stranger
in Jerusalem and Iiast not known
the things which are come to pass
there in these days,
19 And he said unto What
things, And they said unto hinri,
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth which
was a prophet mighty in deed and
word before God and all the people:
20 And! jo w the chief priests and our
nilcrs delivered him to be conderaned
to dead and Iiuve cnicified him.
21 But we trusted the it had
been he wltich should have redeemed
Israel: and bcsitlo all this to day is
the third day since these thing were
done.
22 Yesi, and cerhiin woraen also of
our company made us astonished,
which were early at the sepulchre  f
23 And when they found not his
body, they came, that they
had also seen a visioi) ofangels, which
said that he was alive-
24 And certain of then\ which a r ere
with us went to the sepuldire, and
found it even so as the women had
said: but Inm they saw not,

made as though he would have gone

30 And it came to pass, as he snt
at meat with them, he took breiul,

31 And their eyes were opened,

found the eleven gathered together,

34 Saying, The Lord is risen
indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
35 And they told what things were
done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.
36  And as they thus apake, Jesus
himself stood la the midst of them,

and the Word was God,
2 The same was in the beginning
with God.
Z All things were made by him i
and without him was not any thing
made that was made.
4 In him was life;and the life was
the light of men.
5 And the light shlaeth in darkness
and the darkness comprehended Itn -it,
6 ¶ There was a mm sent from
God, whose name 切似 John,
7 The same came for a witne to
bear witness of the Light, that all
men through him might believe,
8 He was not that Light, but wm
mit to bear witness of that Light,
9 Thai was the true Lights which
Iighteth every man that cometh into
the world.
10 He ms in the world, and the
world was made by him and the
world knew him not
11 He came unto his own, and his
own received him not.
12 But as many as received him, to
them gave he power to become the
pons of God, even to them that believe
on his name:
13 Which were born, not of Hood,

15 ¶ John bare witness of him, and
cried, saying This he of whom
I spake  He that cometh after me
is preferred before ibg; for he was
before me,
16 And of his fulness have all we
received, and grace for grace,
17 For the law was given by Moses^
but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.
18 No man hath seen God at any
time; the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosom of the Father; he hath
declared him.
19 ¶ And this is the record of
John, when the Jews sent priests and
Leyites from Jerusalem to ask him.
Who art thou,
20 And he confessed and denied
not; but confessed, I am not the
Christ.
21 And they asked him, What
then, Art thou Elms, And hesaith,
I am not Ait thou that Prophet,
And he answered, No.
22 Then said they unto him) Who
art thou, that we muy giveao answei 1
to them that sent as lYhat sayest
thou of thyself,
23 He said, I am the voice of
one crying in the wilderness, Make
straight the way of the Lord f as said
the prophet Esaias,
24 And they which were sent were
of the Pharisees.
25 And they asked him, and said
unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
if thou be not that Christ, nor Eiias,
neither that Prophet,
26 John answered them # saying, I
baptize with water: but therestandeth
one among you, whom ye know not;
27 He it is, who coming after me
is preferred before me; whose shoe, a
latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

Bethabara beyond Jordan, where

17 And his disciples remembered
Uiat it was written The zeal of thine
house hath eaten me tip.
18 ¶ Then answered the Jews and
said unto him, W]aat sign she west
thou unto us, seeing that thou doest
these things,
19 Jesus answered and said unto
them. Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up.
20 Then said the Jews, Forty and
six years was this temple in building,
and wilt thou rear it op in three days,
21 But he spake of the temple of
his body.
22 V\ r hen therefore he was risen
from t!)e dead, his disciples remem-
bered that he had said this unto them;
and they believed the Scripture, and
the word which Jesus had said,
23 ¶ TSow when he wa in Jeru-
salem at the passover, in the feast

CHAPTER III,
1 THERE was a man of the Phari-
sees, named jSicodcmus, a ruler
of the Jews:
2 Thesame came to Jesus by nighty
and said unto him, llabbi, we know
that thou art a teacher come from God:
for do man can do these miracles that

him, Verily, rerily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born again, he can-
not see the kingdom of God.

4 Nicodemus saith onto him, How
can a man be born wKen he is old,
can he enter the second time into
his mothers womb, and be born,
5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily I
say unto thee; Except a man be born
of water find of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.
6 That which is born of the flesh
is flesh; and that which la born of
the Spirit is spirit.
7 marvel not that I said unto
thee Ye must be Lorn again.
8 The wind bloweth where it Iisteth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof,
but canat not tell whence it cometh,
and whither it goeth: so is every
one that is born of the Spirit.
9 Nlcodemua answered and said
tin to him, How emi these things be,
10 Jesus answered and said unto
him, Art thou a master of Israel,
and k no west not these things,
11 "V I enly, verily, I say unto thee,
We speak that we do know, and
testify that we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.
12 If I have told you earthly things,
And ye believe not, how shall ye
believe, ifI tell you o/heavenly things,
13 And no man hath ascended up
to heaven, but he that came clown
from heaven, even the Son of man
which is hi heaven.
14 I[ And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up:
15 That whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have
eternal life,
16 ¶ For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlast-
ing life.
17 For God sent not his Son into
the world to condemn the world;
but that the world through Lini
might be saved.

So If And many of the Samariiaos
of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman, which testified,
Ue told me all that ever I did,
40 So when the Samaritans were
如 me unto him, they besought him
that he would tarry with them: and
he abode there two d ays»
41 And many more believed be-
cause of his own word;
42 And said unto the woman, JSTow
we believe, not because of thy saying;
for we have heard him ourselves,
and know that this is indeed the
Christ the Saviour of the world,
431 Now after two days he depart-
ed the noe, and went into Galilee.
44 For Jesus himself testified, that
a prophet hath no honour in his
own cotmtry.
45 Then when he was come Into
Galile the Galikan.s received him^
Vving seen all the things that he
did at Jerusalem at the fenst: for
tlrey also went unto the feast,
46 So Jesus came again into Cana of
C alilee, where he made the water wine.
And there was a certain iiobleman^
whose son was fiick at Capernaum.
47 When he heard that Jesus was
come Oiu of Judm ijitQ Galilee: he
went unto him, and besought him they i
he would come <lown, and heal his
son: for he was at the point <jf death,
48 Thtn said Jesus unto him,

ye will not believe,
仙 The noblcmati saith unto him,
Sir, come down ere my child die.

his servants met him, and told him,
saying, Thy son liveth.
52 Then inquired he of them the
hour when he began to a mead, And
they said unto hjni, Yesterday at ti 沁
seventh hour the fever left him.
53 So the father knew that u was
at the saaie hour, in the which Jesus
saifl unto him, Thy ^on Iiveth; and
himself believed, and his whole
house.
54 Tins is again the second mir-
acle that Jesus did, wbca he was
come out of Judea into Galilee.
CHAPTER V,
A PTER tills there wag a feast of
the Jews; and Jesus went up
to Jerusalem,
2 Now there is at Jerualeoi by
the sheep marled a pool, which is
called in the Hebrew tongue Be-
thesda, having five porelies-
3 In these lay a great multitude
in^potent folk, of bliml, \mlt,

分 And immediately the man wag
made whole and took tip his bed,
and walked: and on the same d&y
was the sabbath.
10 I[ The Jews therefore said
unto him that was cured, It is the
sabbath dny: it ig not lawful for
thee to carry thy bed,
11 he answered them, He that
made t ⑽ whulo, the 紐 me said unto
me, Tako up thy bed and walk.
12 Then disked they him, What
is that which said unto thee.
Take up thy bed, and walk,
13 And he that was healed wist
.iot who it was: for Jesus had otm-
ve^ed himself away, a multitude
being in that place.
14 Afterward Jesus fincleth him
in the temple, and said unto him;
Behold ! thou art made whole: sin no
more, lest a worse thing come unto
Uaee.
15 The man departed, and told the
Jews that it was Jesus, which had
made him whole.
16 And therefore die! the Jews
persecute Jesus and sought to slay
becfitisG he had done these things
on the sa bbat-b day.
17 ¶ But Jesus answered them; M,
Fath^r worketh hitherto, and I work.
18 Therefore the Jews sought the
more to Idll him, because he not only
hud broken they sabbath, but said also
that God was !.is .Pather, making
himself equal with God.
Then answered J^ms find said

you, The Son can do nothing of him-

34 But I receive not testimony
from man: hui these things I say,
that ye might be saved,
35 He was a burning and a aliin-
ing light: and ye were willing far a
season to rejoice in his light.
36 ¶ But I have greater witness
than that of Joliur for the works
which the Father hath given me to
finish, the same works that t do, bear
witness of me, that the Father hath
sent me.
37 And the Father himself, which
hath sent me, hath borne witness of
me. Ye have neither Lord his voice
at any time, nor seen his shape.
38 And yQ have not his word abid-
ing in you: for whom he hath sent,
him ye believe not.
39 ¶ Search the Scriptures; for in
them ye think ye have eternal life:
and they are they \yliieh testify of
me,
40 And ye will not come to me,
that ye might have life.
41 I receive not honour from mei】.
42 But I know you, that ye have
not the love of God in you,
43 I nm come in my Father’s name,
and ye recuive me not: if another
s!mll come in his own name, him ye
will receive,
44 How can ye believe which re^
ceive honour one of another, and seek
not the ]ioTiour that Cometh from God
only,
45 Do not think that I will accuse
you to the Father: there is me that
accuseth you, evm Moses in whom
ye trust.

would have believed me: for he wrote
of me.

CHAPTER VI.
1 AFTER these things Jesus went
over the of Galilee which
is the sea of Tiberias.
2 And a great multitude followed
Inni, because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were
disciasod»
3 And Jesus went up into a moun-
tain, and therehesatwith hisdisdples,
4 And the pa^sover, tt feast of the
Jews, wa« nigh.
5 ¶ When Jesus then lifted up Ah
nm\ saw a great company come
unto him, he sulth unto Philip^
Whencu .shall we hny bread, that
these may eat,
6 And this he said to prove him:
for he himself knew what he would do.
7 Philip answered him. Two him-
dml pennyworth of b^ead is not
sufficient for them, that every one
of them may take a little.
3 Om of his dimply AndreW,
Simon Peter, sbrother 1, saith unto hlm^
9 There is a ] ad he re, which hath
five barley loaves, and two small fislms:
but what are among so many,
10 And Jesus said, Make the men
sit down, Now there was much grass
in the place. So the men sat down,
in number about five thousand,
11 And Jesus took the loaves; and
when ha had givon llmnks the dis-
tributed to the fHwcipIes, and the (us-
ciples to them that were set down;
and likewise of the fishes as much in
they wuiild,
12 When they were filled, he said
wnto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remaiD, that iiotaing
be lost,
13 Therefore they gathered them
together, and filled twelve baskets
with the iragraents of the five barley
]oaves, which remained over and
above unto them that had eaten.

14 Vhm those men, when they
hnrl s^en the mimok that Jesus did f
said, This is of a truth that Prophet
that should come into the world.
15  When Jesus therefore per-
ceived that they would come and lake
him by force, to make him a ldng,
1 扣 departed again into a moimtain
himprif a lone,
10 And when even was now come,
his disciplos wmt down unto the sea,
17 And entered into a ship, and
went over the sea towardCapermiura.
And it was now dark, and Jesus was
not come to them,
18 And the Sea arose by reason of
a great wind that blew,
19 !So when they had rowed about
five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking on the sea^
and drawing nigh unto the ship: and
they were afraid.
20 But he saith unto them, It is
i; ba nor afraid.
21 Then they willingl, received
him into the ship: and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they
went.

into his disciples were entered, and
that Jesus went not with his disciples
into f he boat, but that his disciple
were gone jiway alone,
23 Howbett there came other boats
from Tibenas nigh unto the place
where they eat bread, after that
the Lord l^ad given thaulcs:
24 When the peopk therefore saw
that Jesus was not there, neither his

29 Jesus iiiiawered and said unto
them, This is the work of God, that

30 They said therefore unto him,

31 Our fathers did eat mi^unn in

them bread from heaven to eat.
82 Then Jesus said inito them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses

bread from heaven.
for the bread of God is he

1 AFTER these things Jesus walk-
ed in Galilee: for he would not
walk irt Jesvrj because the Jews
sought to kill him,
2 Now the Jews, foist of taber-
nacles was at hand.
3 His brethren therefore said unto
him, Depart henct and go into
Judea, that thy dLsdpks also may
&&e the works I lint thou cloest,
4 For there is no man thtitdoeth any
thing in secret, and ha hims^lfsaeketh
to be known openly. If thou do these
things, shew thjself to the world,
5 For neither did his brethren
believe in him,
6 I 'lien Jesus saM unto them, My
time is not yet come: but your tirae
is always ready,
7 The world cn^not hate you; hut
me it hateth, because I testify of
that the Nvorks thereof are evil.
8 Go ye up unto this foist: I go
not up yet untiv this feast; for my
time is not ytt full come,
9 When he h ad saki these words
itnio them, he abode still in Galilee»
10 But when Ihs brethren were
gone up, then went he also up unto
the fb 杜 st, nut opeidy, but as it were
in secret.
11 Then the Jews sought him at
the feast, and said, Where is he,
12 And there much iTiurjmiring
among the people coaeerning him:
for sume said, He is a good man:
others said, Nay; but he deedveth
the people.
C9 And we believe and are sure
that thou art that Christ, the Sen
of the living God.
70 Jesus answered them Have
not I o^iosen yen twclvc, and one of
you is a devil,
71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son
of Simon: for he it was that should
betiriy him; being one of the twelve.

13 IIowbelt no man spake openly
of him for fear of the Jews.
14 ¶ Now about the midat of the
feast Jesus went up into the temple,
and taught,
15 And the Jews marvel led, say-
ing, How knoweth this man letters^
having never learned,
16 Jesus answered them, and said,
My doctrine is not mine but his that
sent tne.
17 If any man will do his will, he
shall know of the doetrine, whether it
be of God^or whether I speak of myself,
18 He that speaketh of himself
seeketh his own glory: but he that
eeeketh his glory that sent him, the
same k true, and no unrighteousness
is is him.
19 Did not Moses give you the law,
and yd none of you keepeth the law,
Why go ye about to kill me,
2 ¶ The people answered and said,
Thou hast a devil i who goeth about
to kill thee,
21 Jesus answered and said unto
them, I have done one work, and yet
all marveL
22 Moses therefore gave unto you
circuindsion; (not becatasG it i s
Mo5es, but of the fathers;) and ye on
the sabbath day circumcise a man.
23 If a man on the sabbath day
receive circumcision; that the law of
Moses should not be broken; are ye
angry at me, because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath
day,
24 Judge not according to the
appearance, but judge righteous
judgment,
25 Then said some of them of
Jerusalem, is not this he, whom
they seek to kill,
如 But, lo, he epeaketh boldly,
and they my nothing unto him.

27 Howbeit we know this man
whence he is: but when Christ cometh^
no man knoweth whence he is.
28 Then cried Jesos in the temple
bs I 招 taught, saying, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: and
I nm not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.
29 Bot I know him; for I am
frmn him, and he hath sent me.
30 Then they solicit to take him:
but do man laid hands on him,
because his hour was not jet come.
31 And many of the people be-
lieved on andmkl, When Christ
cometh will he do more miracles than
these which this man hath done,
32 ¶ The Pharisees heard that the
people murmured such things concern-
ing him; and the Pharisees and the
chief priesfs sent officers to take him.
33 Then said Jesus unto them,
Yet a little while am I with you, and
tkm I go onto him that sent me.
34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not
find me! and where I am, thilker
ye cannot come.
35 Then said the Jews among
themselves. Whither will he go, that
we shall not find him, will he go
unto the dispersed among the Gen-
tiles, and teach the Gentiles,
3 ¶ What of saying is this
that he Ye shall seek me, and
shall not find me: and where I am,
thither ye cannot come, i
37 In the last tlay, that great day
of the^feast, Jesus stood and cried,
sayings If any man let him
come unto me; and drink,
38 He that bdieveth on as the
Scripture hath said, out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water.
39 (But this spake he of the Spirit,
which they that believe on hi tn should
receive: for the Holy Ghost was not
yet given; because that Jesus was
not yet glorified.)

258 St. JOHN, VIII
40 ¶ Many of the people thereforej,
when they heard this saying, said,
Of a truth this is the Prophet.
41 Others said, This is the Christ.
But some said, Sh^u Christ; come
out of Galilee,
42 Hath not the Scripture said |
That Christ cometu of the seed of
Davld, and out of the town of Beth-
lelxcm where David was,
43 So there was a division among
the people because of him,
44 And some of them would have
taken him, but no man laid hands
on him,
45 ¶ Then came the officers to the
chief priests and Pharisees, and they
Bakl unto them. Why have ye not
brought hhn,
46 The officers answered, Kever
man spake like this man,
47 Then answered them the Phati-
eees, Are ye also deceived,
48 Have any of the rulers or of
the Pharisees believed on him,
49 But this people who knoweth
not the law are cursed.
50 Wioodemua saith unto them,
(he that came to Jesus by night^
bein one of them)
51 Doth our law judge any man,
before it heat him, and know what
he doeth,
52 They answered and said unto
him, Art thou also of Galilee, Search,
and look i for out of Galilee ariseth
no prophet,
53 And every miui went unto I 113
own house.

章八第翰約
259
3 And the scribes and PhftrisecB
brought I into him a woman taken i a
adullory; and when they liacJ set
her in the midst;
4 They say unto him. Master, this
woman w 贴 taken in ndulter^, in the
very act
5 Now Moses in the law com-
manded us, that such should be
stoned: but what sayest thou,
6 This they said, tempting him,
that they might have to accuse him.
But Jesus stooged dovm, and with
his finger wrote on the ground^
though ha heard them not
7 So when they continued asking
him, he lifted uphimeelf, and said unto
He that is without sin among
you t let him first cast a stone at her.
8 Am! again he stooped dovm,
and wrote on the ground.
9 And they which heard being
convicted by their own conscience,
went cmt oue by ooC, beginning at
the eldest, etm unto tllast: and
Jesus was left alone, and the woman
standing in the midst,
10 Whoa Jesus had lifted U2> him-
self, and saw none but the woman^
he and unto \ier t Woman, where are
those thino accusers, hath no man
condemned thee,
11 She said, Ko man, Lord. And
Jesus said unto her Neither do I
couderau theo r go t and sin no more.
12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto
them, saying, I am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall
not walk in darkness but shall have
the light of life.
13 The Pharisees therefore said
unto him, Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true,
14 Jesus answered and eixki unto
theiB, Though I bear record of my-
self, yet my record is true: for I
know whence I catne, and whither I
go; but ye cauaot telt wheace I
come aiM] whitlaer I go.

16 Yo judge after the flesh; I
judge no man,
10 And yet if I juclgG, my judg-
ment is true: for I am not alone,
bttt I and the Father that sent me.
17 It h also written in your law,
that d in toBtimony of two men is true.
18 I am one that bear witness of
myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth witness of me,
19 Then said they unto hiiu, Where
20 thy Father, Jesus answered, Ye
neither know me, nor my Father: if
ye had known me, ye should have
known my Father also,
20 These words spake Jesus in the
treasury as he taught in the temple:
and no man kid hands on him f for
his hour was not yet come.
21 Then said Jesus again utito
then) ! go my way, and ye shall seek
shall die in your sins: whither
I go, ye cannot come,
22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill
hi in self, beomise he sftith, Wlnther
I go, yo can I tot e 細 e.
23 And he said unto them, Ye are
from beaeftth; I am ftxsm above: ye are
of this world; I am not of this world.
24 I said thercfbro unto you, that
ye shall die in your sins: for if ye
believe not that V am he, ye shall die
in your sins.
25 Then said they unto him, Who
art thou, And Jesus gaith unto
them, E\en the mme that I and
unto you from the beginning,
26 I have many things to say and
to judge of you; but he that sent me
is true; and I speak to die world those
things which I lmve heard of him.
27 They understood not that he
spake to them of the Father.
28 Then said Jesus unto them,
When ye have lifted up the Bon of
man, them shall ye know that I am
he, and that I do nothing of myself,
but as my Father hath taught me I
speak these thing.s.

29 And he that sent Die is with
me: the leather hath not left me
alone; for I do always those things
that please him.
30 AS he snake these words, many
believed on Intn:+
31 Then said Jesus to those Jews
which believed on himjlf ye continue
in my word, then are ye my disciples
indeed;
32 And ye shall know the trath,
and the truth shall make you free.
33 ¶ They answered him, We be
Abraham's seed and were never in
bondage to any man: how sayest
thou, Ye shall be made free,
34 fh^Hwerud them, Verily,
verily: I ^ay unto yeH, Whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin.
35 And the servant abideth not
in the house for ever: but the Son
abideth ever.
36 If the Son therefbro shal l make
you free, ye shall be free indeed»
37 I know that ye are Abraham^
seed; but ye seek to kill nue, because
my word hath no place in you.
38 I speak that which I have seen
with my Father: and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father,
39 They answered and said unto
him, Abvaliiim is our father, Jpstib
saith unto them, Ifye ivere Abraham
children ye would clo the works of
Abraham.
40 But now ye seek to kill me > a

which I have heard of XjocI: this

Then said they to him, We be not

42 Jesus said unto them, If God

44 Ye are ofyour father the devil,
ftud the lusts of your father ye will

Thou art not yet fifty years old, and
hast thou seen Abraham,
58 Jesus,aid unto them Verily 5

ham was, I am.
59 Then took they up stones to

and went out of the temple, going

passed by.
CHAPTER IX.

2 And his disciples asked him, say-

that the works of God should be
made manifest in him.

of the blind man with the clay,
7 And said unto him Go >vash

way therefore, and washed, and came
seeing.
8 ¶ The neighbours therefore, and
they which before had seen him that
he was blinds said, is not this he

26 Then said they to him again^
What did he to iliee, how opened he

wherefore would ye he^r u again,

38 And he said, Lord, I believe.
And he worshipped him.
39 1[And Jesus said, JP'orjudgment
I am come ioto this world, that they
which see not might see; and that
they wJuch see might lbe nwle blind.
40 And some of the Pharisees
wiiieh were with him heard these
W<)rds, and said unto him f Are we
blind also,
41 Jesus said unto them If ye
'were blind, ye should have a-o sitt:
but now ye say, We see; therefore
yoor sin remaineth.
CHAPTER X.
1 VERILY, verily I say unto you,
He that entereth not by the
door into the sheepfbld, but climbeth
up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber.
2 But he that entereth In by the
door is the shepherd of the sheep,
3 To him the porter openeth; and
the hear his voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and
leadeth them out,
4 And when he putteth forth \in
own sheep, he goetk before them,
and the sheep follow him; for they
know his voice,
5 And a stranger will they not fol-
low, but will flee from him; for they
know not the voice of strangers,
6 This i>araHe spake Jesus unto
them; but they miOeretcod not what
things they wert which he spake
unto them.
7 Then s&id Jesus unto them
again. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
I am the door of the sheep.
8 All that ever came before me
are thieves and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them,
9 I am the d oor: by me if any loan
mter in he shall be saved, and shall
go in and out and find pasture.

10 The thief cometh not, but for
to steal, and to kih, and to destroy:
X am come that they might have lif%
and that they might have it more
abundantly.
11 I am the good shepherd: the
good shepherd giveth his life for

12 But he that is a hireling, and
not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,
and leaveth the sheep and fleeth;
and the wolf catcheth them, and
scattereth the sheep.
13 The hirding fleetly because
he is a hireling, and careth not for
the sheep.
14 I am the good shepherd and
know mv sheep, and am known of
mine.
15 AS the Father knoweth me,
even so know I the Father: and I
lay down my life for the sheep,
16 And other sheep I have which
are not of this fold: them ^Iso I
xmist bi ing, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold
and one
shepherd.
:
17 Tljerefore doth my Father lov
me, because I lay (]own my life, that
I might take it again.
18 No mfin taketh it from me, but
I lay it down of tuys^If, I have power
to lay it down 5 and I have power to

have I received of my Father.

thou be the Christ tell us plainly.
25 Jesus answered them, I told
you; and ye believed not the wotks
that I do in my Father’s name, they
bear witness of me.
26 But ye believe not s because ye
sire not of my sheep, as I said imtoyou.
27 My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me;
28 And I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them

me, is greater than all; and no man

do ye stone me,
83 The Jews answered him, 明 ying,

but for blasphemy; and because that

35 If he called them gods, unto
whom the word of God came, and the
Be rip tare cannot be broken;
36 Sny ye of him, whom the Father

CHAPTER XI
"^TOW a certain man was sick,

town of Mary and her sister Martha.
2 (It wasihat Mary which anointed
the Lord with ointment, and wiped
his feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazartis was sick.)
3 Therefore his sisters sent unto
him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
thou lovest is sick,
4 When Jesus heard that, he said,
This sickness is not mito death, but
for the glory of God, that the Son of
God might be glorified thereby,
5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and
her sister, and Lazanis.
6 When he had heard therefore
that he was sick, he abode two (lays
still in the same place where he was.
7 Then after that saith he to his
disciples, Let as go into Judea again.

41 Then they took away the stone
from the place where the dead was
laid. And Jesus lifted up Jm eyes,
at lid said, Father, I thank thee that
thou bast heard me.
42 And I knew that thou hear eat
me always: but because of the people
which stand by I said it t that they
may believe that thou had seat me,

he cried with a loud voice, Lazams,

44 And he that was dead came
forth, bound hfind and foot with

unto 11ie:^, Loose him, and let him go.
45 Thicti many of the Jews which
came to Maty, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on
him.
46 But some of them went their
ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done.
47 ¶ Then gathered the chief
priests and the X J lmrisees a council^
and said, What do we, for this man
doeth many miracle.
48 If we let him thus alone, all
men will believe on him; and the
Romans shall come and take away
both our place and nation.
49 And one of them, named Caia-

year, said unto them, Ye know no

50 Kor consider that it is cxpedleut
for us, that one man should die for
the people, and that the whole imtion
perish not
51 An this spake he not of him-

53 Then from that tta, forth they
toolc icounsd together for to put him
to death.
54 Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the
wildefness^nto a city called Epliralm,
and there continued withliis disciples.
55 ¶ And the Jews, passovesr wag
nigh at band t and many went out
of the couotry up to Jerusalem before
the passover, to purify themselves,
56 Tlum sought they for Jesus,
and spake among themselves, as they
stood in the temple, Mil at think ye,
that he will not come to the ieast,
57 Now both the ehief priests and
the Pharisees had given a eoamiand^
ment, that: if any man knew where
he were, he should shew u f that they
might take him.
CHAPTER XII
1 THEN Jesus six days before the
passover Came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was which bad bmi
dead, whom he raised from the dead.
2 There they made him a supper;
and Afarllja served: but Lazarus way
one of them that pat at the table
with him.
3 Then took Mary a pound of oint-
ment of spikenard very costly, and a-
itointerl the feet of Jesus and wi ped his
feet with her Lair: and the house was
filled with the odour of the ointment.
4 Then saith one of his disciples,
Judas Iscariot Simon’s 娜, which
should betrfty him,
5 Why was not this ointment sold
for three humlred pence, and given
to the poor,
6 Xliis he said, not that he cared
for the poor; but because he was a
thief, and had the bag, and bare what
was put thereiD. ^
7 Then said Jesus’ Let her alone:

9 Much people of the Jews there-
fore knew that he was there: and
they came not for Jesus' sake only,
but that they might seis Lazarus also,
whom he had raised from the dead.
10 But the chief priests consulted
that they might put Lazarus aim to
death;
11 Because that by reason of bico
many of the Jews went awa}% and
believed on Jesus.
12 ¶ Go the aext day much people
that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming
to Jerusalem^
13 Took branches of palm trees,
and went forth to meet him, and
cried, He 册 mm r Blessed is the King
of Israel that cometh in the name of
the Lord.
14 And Jesus f when he had found
 young sat therean; as it is
written,
15 Fear not, daughter of Sion:
behold, thy King cometh, sitting on
an ass’s colt.
16 These things understood not his
disciples at the first: but when Jesus
was glorified  then remembered they
that these things were written of
hipi, and that they had done these
things unto him,
17 The people therefore that s_
with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him
from the dca3, bare record.
For this cause the people also
met him, for that they heard that
he had done this miracle,

21 The same came therefore to
PliiUp, which of Bethsaitla -of
Galilee and desired him, saying. Sir,
we would sco Jesus.
22 Philip cometh and telleth An-
drew: sind again Andrew and Philip
tell Jesus.
23 And Jesus answered them;
saying, The hour is come, that the
Son of man should be glorified.
24 Verily verily, I say unto you,
Except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and dk, it abldeth itlone: but
if it die, it bring{jth forth mu eh fruit,
25 He that ioveth his life shall
lose it, and he that hateth his life
in this world shall koep it unto lile
eteniaL
26 If any maw serve me, let him
follow me; and where I am, them
shall also my servant be: if any man
serve me, him will my leather honour.
27 Now is my soul troubled, and
what shall I say, Father save me
from this hour: but for this cause
came I unto this haur.
28 Father, glorify thy name. Then
came there a voice from heaven,
say/ing, I have both glorified it, and
will glorify it again,
29 The j>cople therefore that stood
by, and heard it, said that it than-
d ered t others said An angel spake
to him.
30 Jesus answered and said, This
voice ciimo not because of me, but
for your sakes,
31 Now is the judgment of this
world: now shall die prince of this
world be cast out,
32 And I, if I be lifted up from
the earth, will draw all mm unto me,
33 This he said, signifyjog what
death be should die.
34 The people answered him, We
have heard out of the law that Christ
abideth for ever: and how sayest
thou. The Son of man must be
lifted up, who is this Son of man,

lest darkness come upon you: for he
that walketh in darkness knoweth

36 While ye have lights believe In

si.nd departed and did hide himself
from them,
37 ¶ But though he had done so
many miracles before themj, yet they
believed not on him:
38 Tlmt the saying of Esaias the
prophet might be fulfilled, which he
spake, Fjord who hath believed our
report, and to whom hath the arm
of the Lord baen revealed,
39 Therefore they conMnothesIieve,
b&cause that jfsiiias said
40 He liflth blinded their eyes, and
Ltirdened Uu^irheart; that theyshould
巧 t see with their eyes, nor understand
with their lieurt) and be converf^d,
and I should heal them.
41 These things .^nid Esaiaa when
he saw his glory; and spake of him,
42 TfN'evertheless an.iong the chief
rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did
not confess him lest they shoold be
put out of the synagogue^
43 Por they loved the pralise of
men more than the praise of God,
44 ¶ Jesus cried and sald He the.t
believeth on me, belie veth not on mo,
but on him that sent me.
45 And he that seeth me seeth him
that sent me.
46 I nm cornea light into thetvorld,

St. JOHN. XIII,
9 Simon Peter saith unto him,
Lord, not my feet only, but also my
bands and my head.
10 Jesus saith to him, He that is
washed needeth not save to wash his
feet, but is clean every whit: and ye
are clean but not all,
11 For he knew who should betray
him; therefore said he. Ye are not
unclean.
12 So after he had washed their
feet, and had taken lua garments, and
was set down again, he said unto them,
Know ye what I have done to you,
13 "Fe call me Master and Lord:
flud ye my well; for so I am.
14 If I theny, /our Lord and Master,
have washed your feet; ye also oughi
to wmh one another's feet.
15 For I have given you an ex-
ample t that ye should do as i have
done to you.
16 Verily, verily I say unto you^
The servant is not greater than his
lord a f neither he that is sent greater
than he that sent Inm.
17 If ye know these things, happy
are ye if ye do them.
18 If I speak not of you all: I know
whom I have chosen: bnt that the
Scripture may be fulfilled; He that
eateth bread with me hath lifted up
his heel against me.
19 Now I tell you before it com^
that, when it is come to pass, ye mny
believe that I am he.
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that recM, iveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me; and he that iToeiveth
me receiveth him that sent me.
23 When Jesus had thus said, he
was troubled in spirit, and testified,
and s^id, Verily, verily, I say unto
that one of you shall betray me,
22 Then the rl isciples looked one on
auother, doubting of whom he spake.
Now there was leaning on
Jesus' bossom one of hk dimples,
whom Jesus loved.

the son of Simon.
27 And after the sop Satan entered
into him. Then said Jesus unto him,
Tfaat thou doest, do quickly.
28 Now no man at the table knew
for whftt latent liespake this unto him.
29 For some of them thought,
liecause) Judas had the bag, that Jesus
had said unto him. Buy those iMng&
that we have need of against the
feast, or, that he should give some-
thing to the poor,
30 He then, having received the
sop, went immediately out; and it
was ni^ht.
31 ¶ Therefore, when he was gone

24 He that loveth me not keepeth
not my dyings: and the word which
ye hear is not mi he, hot the Fatlver^a
which st'nt me,
25 The 站 things have I spoken unto
you, being yet present with you.
26 But the Comforter, v)hich is the
Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my nartie, he shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to
your remerabrance, whatsoever I
have said unto you,
27 Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you: not aa the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.
28 Ye have heard how I said unto
you, I go away, and come again unto
you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice,
because I said, I go unto the Father:
for my Father is greater than I.
2;9 And now I have told you before
it come to pass, that, when it is come
to pass, ye might believe.
30 Hereafter I will not talk much
with you: for the prince of this work!
Cometh and hath nothing in me.
31 But that the world ma, know
that I love die Father; and as the
Father gave me commandment, even
so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

51 am the vine, ye are the branches.
He that abideth in me, and I in him,
the same bringeth forth much fruit;
for without me ye can do nothing.
6 If a man abide not in me he is
east forth as a branch, and is with-
ered; and men gather them, and cast
into the fire and they are burned.
7 If ye abide in me, and my words
a^ide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you.
8 Herein is my Father glorified,
that ye bear nmeh fruit; so shall ye
be my disciples.
9 As the Father hath loved me,
so have I loved you: contiuise ye in
my love.
10 If ye keep my commandments,
ye shall abide in my love; even as I
have kept my Father command-
ments, and abide in his love.
11 These things have I spoken unto
you, that my joy might reicaaia in
you, and that yuur joy might be full.
12 This is my commandment that
ye love one another, as I have loved
you.
13 Greater love hath do man than
this, that a man lay down his life
for his frieuds.
14 Ye are my friends, if ye do
whatsoever I command you.
15 Henceforth I call you not ser-
vauts, for the servant knoweth not
what his lord douth; but I have
called you friends; for all things
that I have beard of my Father I
have made known unto you,
16 Ye have not chosen me, but I
have chosen you, tmd ordained you,
that ye should go and bring forth
fruit, and that your fruit should
remain; that  I Imtsoever ye shall
ask of the Father in my name 5 he

17 These things I command you,

19 If ye were of the world, the
world wou I d love I 1 is own; but because
ye are not of the world, but I have
choacn you out of the world, ther^fore
the world hateth you.
20 Remember the word that I said
unto you, Th servant is not greater
tHan his Iofd. If they have porsecuted
they will also persecute you; If
t^ey have kept my saying, they will
keep yours a.]so.
21 But all these things will tlH'ydo
unto you for my name’s sake, because
they know not him that sent me.
22 If I bad not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had sin; but
now they have no cloak for their sin,
23 He that liateth me hateth mv
Father also.
24 If I had not done among them
the work-s which none other man did)
theiy had not had sin: but now have
they both 兒 cn and haled both me
and my Father.
25 But this co^neth to puss, that
the word might be fulfilled that is
written in their law, They hated me
without a cause-
20 But whei; the Comforter IS
come, whom I will send unto you
from the Father, even the Spirit of
truth, which proecedeth from the
Pather, he slsall testify of me:
27 And ye also shall bear witness^
bccaosc ye have been with mo from
the beginning,
CHAPTER XVI.
rj^IIESE things have I si>oken
丄 unto you, that ye should not be
offended.
2 They shall put you out of the
synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoevtirkilleth you will think
that he doeth God service,
3 And these things will they do
you, because they have not
known the Father nor my.

4 But the 晷 things have I told you,
thal when the time shall come, ye
may remember that I told you of
them. And these things I said not
unto you at the b^gimiing, because I
was with you.
5 But now I go my way in him
that sent me; and none of you asketh
me, Whither goest thou,
6 But because I have said these
things unto yo sorrow hath filled
your heart.
7 Keverthele^s I tell you the truth;
It is expedient for you that I go
away: for if Igo not away, the Com-
forter will not come unto you; but if
I depart, I will send him unto you.
8 And when he is come, he will
reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment:
9 Of sin, because they believe not
on me,
10 Of righteousii&ss, because I go
to my Father, and ye see me no more,
11 Ofjttdgment, because the prince
of this w orld is judged,
12 I have yet many things to
say all to you, but ye cannot bear
thorn now.
13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of
truth, is come, he will guide you into
all trnth: for he sJmll not .speak of
himself; but whatsoever be shall
h 〒 ar, that shall he speak; and he
will shew you things to come.
14 He shall glorify me: for he
shall receive of mine, and shall shew
it unto you.
15 All thengs that the Father
hath are mine: therefore said I,
that he shall take ofmine and shall
fthtw it unto you.
IGA httle whik, and ye shall
wot see me; and agaii a littlewhile,
and ye shall zee me t bectui 兜 I go

17 Then said sortie of Kis disciples
among themselves What is this that
he earth unto us, A little wMle, and
ye shall not see me: and again, a
little whi]e, and jq shall see: and,
Because I go to the Father,
18 They said therefore What is
this thnt he A little while,

19 Now Jesus knew that they were
desirous to ask him f and said unto
them Do inquire among your-
selves of that I said, A little while 3
and ye shall not see me: and again,
a little while, uikI ye ahull see me,
20 Verily, verily, I sixy unto you,
That ye shall weep and lament, but
the world shall rejoice; and ye shall
be sorrow fill, but your sorrow shall
be turned into joy^,
21 A woman when she is in travail
hath sorrow, because her hour is
come: bnt as soon as she is delivered
of' the ehikl, she remembereth no
more the anguish, for joy that a
man is born into the world,
22 And ye now therefore have
sorrow; but I will see ) t on again,
and your heart shall rejoice, and
Your joy no man taketh from you.
23 And in that day ye shall nsk me

WImtsoever ye shall ask the leather
in my name, he will give it you.
24 thtliorto have ye asked nothing
in my name; ask, and ye shall

25 These things have I spoken
unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I sluill no more speak
unto you in proverbs but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father.
26 At that day ye shall ask in my
name: and I say not unto you that
I will pray the Father for you:
27 I^or the Father himself loveth
you, because ye have loved me and
have believed that I came out from

章七十第翰約
6 I have maEifested thy name uji-
to the niea ■which thou gavest me out
of the world: thine they were, and
thou gayest them oie; and they lmve
kept thy word.
7 Now they have known that all
things whatsoever thou hast given
ms a re of thee,
8 For I have given unto them the
words which thou gavest me; and
they have received thmn, and have
known surdy that I e^ime out from
thee, and they have believed that
thou didst send me.
9 I pray for them: I pray not for
the world, but for them which thou
hast given me; for they are thine,
10 And all mine are thine, and
thine are mine; and I am glori find
in them,
11 And now I am no more in the
we rid, but these are in the world, and
I coiim to thee. Holy Father, keep
through thine own name those whom
thou hast given me f that; they may
be one, as we are,
12 While I wtis with them in the
world, I kept them in thy name;
those that thou gav^t me I have
kept, and none of them is lost, but
the son of perdition; that the Soi ip-
ture might be fulfilled.
13 And now come I to thee; and
t]i 吒 e things I speak in the world,
that they might have my joy fulfilled
in themselves
14 I have given them thy word;
and the world hath hated thesm, be-
cause they are not of the world, even
as I am not of the world.
15 I pray not that thou si ion Iciest
take them out of the world, but that
thou shouldest keep them from the
evil.
16 They are not of the world, even
as I am not of the world.
IT Sanctify them through thy
truth: thy word is truth.

18 AS thou hast sent me into the
world, even so have I also 视 nt them
into the world.
19 And for their sakes I sanctify
myself, that they also might be saac-
tified through the truth.
20 Xeither pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall believe
on me through their word;
21 That they all may be one; as
thou, ! art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may W one in
vis: that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me.
22 And the glory which thou gavest
me I have given them; that they
may be one, even as we are one:
23 I in them, and thou in me,
that they tuay be nificle perfect ill
one; and that the world in ay know
that t!ion hast sent nae, and Iiast
loved them, as thou bast loved me t
24 Father, I will that, they also,
whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I nra; that they may be-
hold my glorywhich thou hast given
me: fox thou lovedst me before the
foundation of the world,
25 o righteous Father the world
hath not known theo: but I have
known the f e f and these have known
that thou Last sent me.
26 And I have declared unto them
thy name, and will declare it; that
the love wherewith thou hast loved
me may be in them, and I in
them,

Put up Ihy sword into the sheath:

given, me’ shall I not drink it,
12 Then the band and the captam
and officers of the Jews took Jesus
and IjquikI him,
13 And led him away to Annas
first; for he was father in law to
Cabphas which was the high pi ieat

14 Now Caiaphas was he which
gave coitheel to the Jews, that it
was expedient that one man should
die for the people.
15 ¶ And Simon Peter followed
Jesus, and so did another disciple:
that disciple was known unto the
high priest, and went in with Jesus
into the palace of the high priest.

28 ¶ Then led they Jesus from
Caiiiphas unto the hall of judgment:
and it was early \ and they themselves
went not into the judgment Iiall, lest
they should be defiled; but that they
might eat the passover.
29 Pilate then went out unto them,
and said, What accusation bring ye
against this man,
SOThcja as wer ed and sa i d u otohiin,
If he were not a male factor, we would
not have delivered him up unto thee.
31 Then said Pilate unto them,
Take ye him, and judge him accord-
ing to your law. The Jews therefore
said onto him, It is not lawful for us
to put any man to death:
32 That the saying of Jesus might
be fallilled, which he spake signify^
ing what death he should die.
33 Then Pilate entered into the
judgment hall again, and called
Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou
the King of the Jews,
34 Jesus answered him, Sayest
thou this thing of thyself, or did
others tell it thee of me,
So Pilate answered, Am I a Jew,
Thine own nation and the chief
priests have delivered ibee unto me:
what hast thou done,
30 Jesus answered, My kingdom
is not of this world: If my kingdom
were of this world f then would my
servant fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews i but now is
my ktiigdom not from hence-
37 Pilate therefore said unto him,
Aittlioo a king then, Jesus answered^
Thou suyest that I am a king. To

11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest |
have no power at all against me,
except it were given thee from
above: therefore he that delivered
me unto thee hath the greater sin,
12 And from thencefovth Pilate
sought to release him: but the Jews
cried out, saying, If thou let this
man go, thou art not Cesar's friend:
whosoever nmketh himself a king
spealceth against Cesar,
18 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard
that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
and sat dowo In the judgment seat in
u place that is called the Pave men t,
but In the Hebrew, Gabbatha,
14 And it was the preparation of
the passover, said about the bixth
hour: and he saith unto the Jews,
Behold your King!
15 But they eriird out, Away with
hi t in i aiivay with him, crucify him.
Pilate saith unto theiai, Shall X crucify 1
your King, The chief priests an-
gwered, We have no king but Cesar,
16 Then delivered he him there-
fore unto them in be urucfic^L And
they took Jesus, and led him away.
17 And he bearing his umsa went
forth Into a pkee called the plaee
of a skull, wlvich is called in the
Hebrew Golgotha:
18 Where they crucified bini, and
two others with h!in J on either sick
one, and Jesus hx the miJst.
19 1l And Pilate wrote a title, and
put it on (he cross. And the writing
JRSUS OF NAZARETH
THE KljSFG OF THE JEWS-
20 This title then reiul many of
the Jews; for the place wheie Jesus
was crucified was uigh to the city:
and it wag written in Hebrew and

themselves, Let us not rend it but
cast lots for H, whose it shall be:
that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
which saith, They parted my raiment

did east lots. These things therefore
the soldiers did.

and now they were not able to draw

7 Therefore that disciple whom
Jesus loved saith unto l^eter, It is

liciird that it was the Lord, liegirt his

8 And the other disciples came in

11 Simon Peter wentup, and d rew

12 Jesus gaith unto them, Come
and dine. And none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou, know-

13 Jesus then cometh, si ml taketh

14 This is now the third lime that
Jesus slieml himself to his disciplys,

St. JOHN, XXI
17 He faith unto him the third
time, Siinon son of Jonas, lovest thou
me, Peter was grieved because
he said unto him the third time,
liovest thou me, A ad he said unto
him, Lord, d^on knowest all things,
thou k no west that I love thee +
Jesus saith unto him, Feed my
sheep.
18 V erily, verily I say unto thee,
W lien thou wast young, thou girclcdsi
tlsyself, and walkcdst whither thou
wouklest: but when thou shalt be
old, thoTi slmlt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee,
and mirry thee whither thou wculdest
HOt.
19 This spake he, signifying by
what death he should glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he
saith unto him, Follow me,
20 Thou Peter, tinning about, seeth
the disciple whom Jesus loved follow-
ing; which alf,o leaned on his bro^st
at supper  and eakl, Lord which is
he that betrayeth thee,
21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus,
Lord, and what shall this man do 2
22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will
that he tarry till I come, what is that
to thee, follow thou me.
23 Then went this saying abroad
among the brethren that that disciple
shonkl not die: yet Jesus said not
unto him, He shall not die; but, If
I will that he tarry till I coioe what
is that to thee,
24 This is the di&ciplc which test!-
fieth of these things, and wrote these
things: and we know that his testi-
mony is true.
25 And there are also mituy other
things which Jesus did, the which, if
they should be written every one, I
suppose that even the world itself
ooi]Id not oc^ntain the books that
should be written. Amen.

10 And while they looked stead-

white apparel;
11 Which also said, Ye men of
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven, this same Jesus, which is
taken up from you into heaven, shall
So come in like maimer as ye have
seen him go into heaven.
12 Then returned they unto Jeru-
salem from the mount called Olivet,
Whick is from Jerusalem sabbath

13 And when they were come In,
they went up into an upper room;
where abode both Peter, and James,
and John, and Andrew Philip, and
Themas》Bartholomo w, and Matthew,
James the soa of Alplieus, and Simon
Zelotes, and Jwdfls the brother of
James,
14 The^e all continued with one
accord in prayer and supplication 7
with the women and Mary the mother
of Jesus, and with his brethren.
lalf And in those days Peter stood
up in the midst of the disciples and
said,(the number of names together
were about a himdred and twenty)
Men and bied 】 ren, this Scrip-
ture must needs have been fulfilled,
which the Holy Gbost by the mouth
of David spake before con earning
Jndas, which was guide to them
that took Jesus.
17 For he was numbered with us,
and had obtained part of this ministry.
18 Now this man purclmsed a field
I^rith the reward of iniquity; and fall-

19 And it was known unto all the

tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,
The field of blood.

of the resurrection of Christ that his

32 This Jesus hath God raided up,
whereof we all are witnesses.
33 Therefore being by the right
hand of God exalted; and Imving
received of the Father the promise of
the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
this, which ye now see and hear.
34 For David is not ascended into

36 Therefore let all the house of
Israel know assn red Iy, that God hath
made that game Jesus, whom ye have
crucified, both Lord and Christ.
37 ¶ Now when they heard this,
they were pricked in their heart, and
said unto Peter and in the rest of the
apostles, Mea and brethren, what
shall we do, »
38 Then Peter said unto them,
Repent^, and be baptised every one

for the remission of sins, and ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost,

22 For Mos^s truly faid unto the

your God raise up unto you of your
brethren, Hke unto me; him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever he
shall say unto you,
23 And it shall come to pass, that
every soul, which will not hear that

6 And Anna the high priest, and
Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the kindred
of the high priest, were gathered
together at Jemgalem,
7 And when they had set them
in the midst, they asked, By what
power, or by what name have ye

8 Then PsteT, filled with the Holy
Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of

9 If we this; day be esamined of the

10 Be it known unto you all, and
to all the people of Israel, that by
the name of Jesus Christ of Kazareth,
whom ye crucified, whom God raised
from the dead, evm by him doth this

11 This is the stone which was set
at nought of you builders, which is
become the head of the comer.
12 Neither is there salvation in
any other: for there is none other
name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved.
13 ¶ Now when they saw the
Iboldness of Peter and John, and

the feet of them which have buried

29 ¶ Then Peter and the other
apostles answered and said, We ought

11 Now there came a dearth over

found no sustenance.
12 But when Jacob heard that
there was com in Egypt, he mnt out
oar fathers first.
18 And at the second time Joseph
Wen, made known to his brethren,
and Joseph’s kindred was made
known unto Pharaoh.
14 Then genfe Joseph, and called
his father Jacob to him, and all his
kindred, threescore and fifteen souls,
15 SoJ acob went down into Egypt,
and d ied, he, and otir fathers,
16 And were carried over into
Sycheni, and laid in the sepulchre
that Abraham bought fbt a sura of
money of the cons of Emmor, the
father of Sycliem.
17 But when the time of the pro-
mise drew nig]i, which God had
sworn to Abraham, the people grew
and multiplied in Egypt,
18 Till another king arose, wLich
knew not Joseph.
19 The same dealt subtiiely with
our kiadred, and evil entreated our
father, ko that they cast out their
young children to the end they
oiight not live.

an<I was exceed] fair, and nourished
up in his fatli6r, a house three months:
21 And when he was cast out,
PJmraol^s daughteT took him up, and
nourished him for her own son.
22 And Mosea was learncti is all
the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
was mighty in words and in deeds.
23 And when he was foil forty
years old, it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of
Israel
24 And seeing one of them suffer
Wiong, he defended him, and avenged
him that was oppressed and smote

unto the children of Israel, A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up
unto you of your brethren, like unto
me; him nhM ye hear.
38 This is that was is the
church in tise wilderness with the
angel whid I spake to him in the
mount Sina, and vdih our fathers:
who received the lively oraeks to
give unto us:
39 To whom our fathers would not
obe/, but theust him from them > and
in their hearts turned back again
into Egypt,
40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us
gods to go before us: for of for this
Moses, which brought us out of the
land of Egypt, we wot not what is
become of him.
41 And they made a calf in those
days, and offered sacrifice unto the
idol, and rejoiced in the works of
their own hamh,
42 Then God turned, and gave
them up to worship the host of
heaven; as it is written in the book
of the prophets i o ye house of Israel 3
have offered to me slain beasts
and sacrifices by the space of forty
years in the wildeniess V
43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle
of Moloch, and the star of your god
Hemplmn figures which ye made to
worship them: and I will carry you

44 Our fathers had the tabernacle
of witness in the wlklen^ess as he
had appointed, speaking unto Moscs,
that he eiioukl make it according to
the fashion that he had sgod.
45 Which also our fathers that
Came after brought in with Jesus in to

God dravc out before the face of our

1 AND Saul was consenting unto
一 ___ his death. And at that time
there was a great persecution agiimst
the ctmreh which was at Jerusalem;
and they were all scattered abroad
throughout the regions of Judea and
Samaria, except the apostles.
2 And devout men carried Stephen
to his buried, and made great lameo-
tation over him.
3 AS for Saul, he made havoc of
thectmrch, entering into every house 3
and lialing mm asm d women commit-
ted them to prison,
4 Therefore they that were scatter-
ed abroad went every where preach^
ing the word.
5 Then Philip went down to the
city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.
6 And the people with oue accord
gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the
miracles which he did.
7 For unclean spirits, crying with
loud voice, came out of many that
were possessed with (hem: and raany
taken with palsies, and that were
larae, were hen led,
8 And there was great joy in that
city,
9 But there was a certain nmsi,
called Simon, which beforetime in the
same city used soreery, and bewitched
the people of Samaria, giving out that
himself was some great one:
10 To wham they all gave l]wl,
from the least to the greatest, saying,
This man is the great power of God t
11 And to him they had regard,
because that of long time he bad
bewitched them with sorceries,
12 But when they believed Philip
prewching the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women.

prayed for them, that they
might receive the H 0 I, Ghost 1
16 (For as yet he was fallen upon

17 Then laid they their hands on
them, and they received the Holy

18 And when Simon eaw that
tjurough laying on of the apostles’
hands the Holy Ghost was given, he
offered them money,
19 Saying, Give me also this power,
that on whomsoever I ky hands) he
may receive the Holy Ghost,
20 But Peter said unto him; Thy
money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God

21 Thou hast neither part nor lot
in this matter: for thy heart is not

wickedness, and pray God y if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be
forgiven thee,

said, Pray ye to the Lord for me s

21 But all that heard him 'SiFe

that destroyed them which called on
this name in Jerusalem<,ra, and came
hither for that intent, that he might
bring them bound unto the chief
priests,
22 But Saul increased the more xu
etrength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Damascus, proving
that this is very Christ
23 And after that many days
were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
to kill him:
24 But their laying wait was known
of Saul And they watched the gates
day and night to kill him.
25 Then the disciples took him by
night, and Jet him down by the wall
in a basket.
26 And when Saul was come to
Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
to the disciples: but they were all
afraid of him, and believed not that
he was a disciple,
27 Barnabas took him, and
brought him to the apostles and
declared unto them how he Iiad seen
t]ne Lord in the wa}、and that he had
spoken to him, and how he had
preached boldly at Damascus in the
name of Jesus.
28 And he was with them coming
in and going out at Jerusalem.
29 And he spake boldly in the
name of the Lord and disputed
against the Grecians: but they went
about to slay him.
30 Which when the brethren kriew^
they brought him down to Cesar%
and sent him forth to Tarsus.
31 Then had d】e charcliee rest

32 ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter
passed thruughout all quarterSf he
came down also to the saints which
dwelt at Lydda.
33 And there he found a certain
mati jiamed Encas, which had kept
his had eight years, and was sick of
the palsy. ^
34 And Peter said onto him, Ene^
Jesus Christ malceth thee whole:
arise; and make thy bed. And he
arose immediately.
Z5 And all that d welt at Lydda and
Saron saw him, and tamed to the Lord.
36 ¶ Now there was at Jopjm a
certain di&ciplonam^dTabitha which
by interpretat-ioa is cfilled Dorcas:
this woman was fulL of good works
and almsflee(3s which sho did.
37 And it came to pass in those
days, that she was siet, and d ied:
whom when they had washed they
laid her in mi Ripper chamber,
38 And forasmuci as Lydda was
nigh to Jo]ipa, add the disciples had
heard that Peter was there, they sent
unto him two mci desiring him that
he would imt delay to come to them.
39 Then Peter arose and went
with them. When he was come, they
brought him into the upper chamber:
and all the widows stood by him
weeping, and she wing the cuats and
garments which Dorcas made, while
she was with thefra.
40 But Peter put them all forth 3
and kiiecled (Iqwti, and prayed: and
turning him to the body said, Tabitha,
arise. And she opened her eyes: and
when she saw Peter, she sat up,
41 And he gave her his hand, and
lifted her up; and when he bad called
the saints and widows, he preseated
her alive.
42 And itwasknow through out all

CHAPTER X.
1 T^HEKE was a certain man in
Cesarea called Cornelius, a
eentarion of the band called the
Italian band f
2 A devout man, and one that
feared God with all his house, which
gave much alms to the people and
prayed to God always.
3 He saw in a vision evidently,
about the ninth hour of the day, an
angel of God coming in to him, and
saying unto him, Cornelius.
4 And tv hen he looked on him, he
wag afraid, and sai<J, "What is
Lord, And he said unto him Thy
prayers and thine alms are come up
for a memorial before God.
5 And now send men to Joppa,
and call for one Simon whose sur-
name is Peter:
6 He lodgeth with one Simon a
tanner, whose house is by the sea
side: he shall tell thee what thou
oughtest to do.
7 A oil when the angel which spake
unto Cornelius was departed, he
called two of his household servants,
and a devout soldier of them that
waited on him continually;
8 And when he had declared all
these things unto them, he sent them
to Joppa.
9 On the morrow, as they went
on their jouniey, and drew nigh unto
the cifey Peter went up upon the
housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
10 And he became very hungry^
find would have eaten: but while they
made r^atly he fell into a trance,
11 And &aw heaven opened and
a certain vessel descending unto
him, as if: had been a great sheet
knit at the four corncrs, and lefe
down to the earth:
12 Wherein were all maimer of
fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
wild beasts, and creeping things, and
fouls of Ibe air.

13 And there came a voice in him,
Arise, Peter; kill, and eat. 、
14 But Peter said; ~Not so, Lord;
for I have never eaten any thing
that is common or unclean.
15 And the voice spake unto him
again the second time, What God
hath cleansed, that cal! not thou
common.
10 This was done thrice: and the
vessel was received up again into
heaven,
17 Now while Peter doubted in
himself v, hRt this vision which he
had seen, shonM raean, behold the
men which were sent from Cornelius
had made inquiry fox Simon, sIiouse,

18 And called, and asked whether
Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
were lodged there,
19 If while Peter thought on the
vision, the Spirit said unto
Behold, three men seek thee.
20 Arise therefore, and get thee
down, and go with them, doubting
nothing: for I have sent them.
21 Then Peter went down to the
men which were sent unto him from
Cornelius  f and said, Behold I am
he whom ye seek: what is the cause

25 Afa.fl ris Peter was com log in.
Cornelios met him, and fell clown
at his feet, and worshipped him.
26 But Peter took him up, saying 7
Stand op \ I mjself al^o am a man.
27 And as he talked with him > he
went in, and found many that were
co 咖 together.
28 And he said unto them. Ye
know how that it is an unlawful
thing far r man that is a Jew lo keep
company or come unto one of an-
other nation; but God hath shewed
me that I should not call any man
common or unclean,
2d Therefore came I unto you
without gaitisaying, as soou as J was
sent for: I ask therefore for what
intent ye have sent for me,
30 And Cornelius said Four days
ago I was fasting until this hour;
and at the niuth hour I prayed lo
my hotise, and, behold, a man stood
before me in bright clothing,
31 And said, Cornelms, the prayer
is heard, and thine alms are and in
remembrance in the sight of God.
32 Send therefore to Joppa, and
call hither Sitacm, whose surname is
Peter; he is lodged in the house of
on« Simon a tanner by the sea side:
who, when he cometh, shall speak
unto thee,
33 Immediately therefore I sent
to thee; and thou hast well clone that
thou art come. - Now therefore are
we all here present before God, to
hear all things that are commanded
thee of God.
34 IT Then Peter op^ued his raouth,
and said, Of a truth I perceive that
God is do respecter of persons:
35 But in every nation he that
feareth him, and worketh righteous-

37 That word, I say f ye know,
which was published throughout all
Jmlca, and began from Galilee, after
the baptism which John preached;
58 How God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
with power: who went about doing
good, and healing au that were
oppressed of the devil; for God was
■with him.
39 And we are witnesses of all
things which he did both in the land
of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom
they slew and hanged oa a tree:
40 Him God raised op the third
day, and shewed him openly;
41 Not to all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God, even
to us, who did eat and drink with
him after he rose from the dead,
42 And he commanded us to
preack unto the people and to testify
that it is he which was ordained of
God to be the Judge of quick and
dead.
43 To him give all the prophets
witness, that through his name who-
soever believeth in him shall receive
remission of sins.
44 ¶ While Peter yet spake these
words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them which heard the word,
4o And they of the dreumcision
which believed were astonished as
many as came with Peter, because
that on the Gentiles also 、\邮 poured
out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
46 For they heard them speak with
tongues, and magnify (jod Then
answered Peter,
47 Can ati, man forbid water, that
these sIiod kl not be baptized, which
have recei ved the Holy Ghost as well
as we,

Then prayed they him to tany cer-

circumcision conteaded with him,
3 Saying, Thou whitest in to men

heaven by four corners; and it came
even to me:
6 Upon the which when I had
fastened mine I considered, and
saw four foot eel beasts of the earth,
and wild beasts; and creeping things,
and fowls of the air.
7 And I heard a voice saying unto
me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for
aothing common or unclean hath at
an, time entered into my month,
9 But the voice answered me
again from heaven, WIIat God hath

which had been brought up with
Herod the tetraren, and Saul,
'I AS they ministered to the Lord,
and kstcdy, the Holy Ghost said,
Sr jm rate me Bar mi bag and San I for
the work whereunio I have called
thim.
3 And whrii they had fasted and
prayed # and laid their haucls on them,
they pent them away.
4, J So they, being sent forth
b y live ]loly Ghost, departed unto
iSekucia; and from thence they
sailed to Cyprus,
5 And w! in\ they were at Salaniis,
they preached the uord of God in
the synagogues of the Jews: and
they had also John to their minister.
6 And when they had gone f.hrough
the isle unto Paplios, they found a
certain soreereT, a false prophet, a
Jew, wJjosc name was Bar-jesns:
7 Which was with the deputy of
the countiy, Sergius Pan I us, a pru-
dent man; who called for Barnabas
and Saul, and desired to hear the
word of God,
8 But Ely mas the sorcerer (for so
is his name by interpretation) with-
stood them; seeking to turn away
the deputy from the faith.
9 Then Saul, (who also called
Paul:) filJed with die Holy Ghost^
set his eyes on him,
10 And said, o full of all subtilty
and all mischief, thou child of the
devil, tfion enemy of all righteous-
nesfl, was thou not cease to pervert

22 And when he had removed him,
he raised up unto them David to be
their king, to whom also he gave
testimony, and said, I have fotiad
David the sah of Jesse, a man after
mine own heart, which shall fulfil all
my will,
23 Of this man’s seed hath God,
according to his promise, raised unto
Israel a Saviour Jesus:
24 When John had first preached
before his coming the baptism of
rep-eutauoe to ah the people of Israel.
25 And in John fulfilled his course,
he whom think ye that I nm,
I am not he. But, behold, there
cornelb one after me, whose shoes of
his feet I am not worthy to loose.
26 Men and brethren, children of
the stock of Abraham aafl whosoever
among you feareth God, to you is the
word of this salvation sent.
27 For they that dwell at Jen 班卜
lem, and their rulers because they
knew him not, nor yet the voices of
the prophets which are read every
sabbath day, they have fulfilled them
in condemning him.
28 And though they found no cause
of death in him, jet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain,
2 9And when they had fulfiled all
that wits written of him, they look
him down from the tree, and laid him
in a sepulchre.
30 But God raised him from the
dead:
31 And he was many days of
them which came up with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his
witnesses unto the people.
32 And we declare unto you glad
tidings, how that the promise which
was made unto the fathers^
33 God liath fulfilled the same
unto us their children is that helmth

34 And as concerning that He
raised him up from the dead, now no
more to returu to corruption he said
on this wise, I will give you the sure
shercies of David,
35 Wherefore he saiUi also in
another psalm 9 Thou shalt not suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption-
For Davit!, after he had served
his own generation by ibe will of
God, fell on sleep, and was kid
unto his Others, and saw corruption:
37 But he, whom God raised again^
saw no comiption.
38 ¶ Be H known unto you there-
fore, nicn and brethren, that through
iliis man is preached unto you the
forgiveness of sins i
39 And by him all that believe are
justified from all things, from which
ye coiikl not be justified by the law
of Mosf s,
40 Beware therefore, lest i\mt come
upon you, which is spoken of h in the
prophets;
41 Behold, ye despisers, and won-
der, and perish: for I work a work
id your days, a work which ye shfth
in no wise believe, though a man
declare it unto you.
42 And when ths Jews were
gone out of the synagogoe, the
Geatiles besought that these words
might be preached to iliem the next
sabbath.
43 Now when, the congregation was
broken up, many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul and
Barmibfis; \\he f speaking to them,
persuaded them to continue in the
grace of God.
44 T1 And the next sabbath day
came almost the whole city together
to hear the word of God.
45 But when the Jew_s eaw the
multitudesjthey werefilled with envy,
and spake against those things which
were spoken by Paul, contracllcting
and blaspheming. ^

46 Thqu Paul and Barnabas waxed
bold, and said, It was necessary that
the word of God should first have
been spokoa to you: but seeing ye
put it I rom you, and judge your-
selves unworthy of ever last log life,
lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
47 For in hath the Lord com-
mande sayinff, I have set thee
to b& a light of the Gentiles, that
thou si ion Ide^t be for salvation unto
the ends of the earth,
48 And when the Gentiles heard
this, they were glad; and glorified the
word of the Lord i and as many ag
were ortkined to eternal life believed.
49 And the word of the Lord was
published throughoirt all the rrglon.
60 But the Jews stirred up the
devout and honourable women, and
the chief men of the city, and raised
persecution against Paul and Burna-
tas, and expelled them out of their
coasts.
51 But they shook off the dust of
their feet against them, and came
unto Iconiura.
52 And the disciples were filled
with joy, and with the H 0 I, Ghost

2 But the unbelteving Jews stirred
up the Gontiles, and made their minds

17 Nevertheless he left not himself
without witness, in that he did good,
aed gave us rain from heaven, and
fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
with food and gladness.
18 And with these sayings scarce
restrained they the people, that they
had not done sacrifice onto them.
19l| And there came thither captain
Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
persuaded the people, and, having
stoned Paul, drew him out of the
city, supposing he had been dead.
20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood
round about him, he rose up, and
came into the cityi and the next
day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe,
21 And when they had preached
the gospel to that cky, and had taught
miui-y, they returned again to Lystra,

disciples, and exhorting them to
continue in the faith, and that we
must througtt much tribulation enter

CHAPTER XX.
1 KD certain men which came
down from Judea taught the
brethren, and said, Except ye be
circumcised after the mtmner of
Moses, 70 cannot be saved 甲
2 When therefore Paul and Bar-
nabas had no small dissension and
disputation with then], they deter-
mined that Paul and Earn abas, and
certain other of them shauld go up
to Jerusalem unto the apostles and
elders about this question.
3 And being brought on their way
by the church, they paased through
Phetiioe and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles: nut! thef
caused great joy unto all the brethren.
4 And when they were come to
Jerusalem, they were received of the
church, and of the apostles and
elders, and they declare a all things
that God bad done with them.
5 But there rose up certaia of the
- sect of the Pharisees which believed,
i,aying, That it was needful to cir-
cumcise them, and to coiiuisatid them
to the law of Moses.
6 ¶ And the apostles and elders
came together for to consider of ibis
matter.
7 And when there l 】 ax] been much
disputing, Peter rose up and said
unto them, Mpix and brethren! ye
know Low that a good while ago Gtd
made choice among us 》 that the
Gentiles by my mouth should hear
tlie word of the gospel and believe,
8 And God, which luioweth the
hearts, bare thena witness giving
them the Holy Ghost, even as he did
unto us;
9 And put no difference between
us and them, purifying their hearts
by faith.
10 Now therefore why tempt ye
God, to put a yoke upon the neck of

11 But wt; believe that through
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
we shall be saved, even as they.
12 ¶ Then all the multitude kept
silence, and gave audience to Barna-
bas and Paul, declaring what mirncles
and wonders God had wrought among
the Gentiles by them.
13  And after they had held their
peace, James answered, saying, Men
and brethren, hearken unto me:
14 Simeon hath declared how God
at the first did visit the Gentiles, to
take oat of them a people for his
name.
15 And to thia agree the words
of the prophets; as it is written;
16 After this I will reHum, and
/will build again the tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and I
will build &gain the roins thereof,
and I will set it up:
17 That the residue of men might
seek after the Lord, and all the
Gentiles, upon tvhom my name is
called, sflith the Lord, 可 bodoeth all
these things.
18 Known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the world,
19 Wherefore my sentence i, that
we trouble not them, which from
flniong the Gentiles are tnrned to
God:
20 But that we write unto them,
that they abstain from pollutions of
idols, and/rom fornioation, and from
things strangled and from blood.
21 For Moses of old time hath is
every city iham that preach him,
being read iti the synagogues %yery
sabbuth day,
22 Then pleased It the apostles
and elders, with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own

Barnahns; namely’ Judas surnamed

23 And they wrote letters by them
after this manner; The apostles and
elders and brethrengreeting unto
the brethren which are of the Gentiles
ill Antioch and Syria and Cilkla:
24 forasmuch as we hayfe neard,
that o^rtam which went out from as
have tlroubkd you with words, sub-
verting your sools, saying, Ye mnd
be dmimcised, and keep the law; to
tv horn we gave nos uch command merit;
25 It seemed good unto b&ui^
assenihkd with oue accord to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved
Barnabas and Paul,
26 Men that have hazarded their
lives for the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
27 W e have sent therefore Judas
and Silns, who shall also to]l yott the
same things by mouu:.
28 For itseemed goo^I fo the Holy
Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no
greater burden tlmn these necessary
things;
20 That ye absiai a from meats
offered to idols, and from bloody and
from things strangled, and fro rat for-
nication: from which if ye keep your-
selves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
30 So when they were disroiased,
they came to Antioch; and when
they had gathered the multitude
together, they delivered the epistle i
31 WAieh when they had read,
they rejoiced for the consa]ation.
32 And Judas and Silas being
prophets also themselves, exhorted
the brethren with mimy words, and
confirmed them,
33 And after they had tarried there
a they were let go in peace
from the brethren unto the apostles.
34 Notwithstanding it pleased
Silas to abide there still.
35 Pan! also and Barnabas con-
tinued in Autioeh, teaching and

take him with them, who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and
went not with them to the work
39 And the contention was so sharp

3 Him would Paul iiave to go forth

him because of the Jews which were
in those quarters; for they knew all
that his father was a Greek.

which is the chief city of that part of
Macedonia, and a colony: and we
were in that city abiding eerfain days,
13 And on the sabbath we went
out of the city by a river eide where
prayer was wont to be made; and we
eat down, and epake onto the women

Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
of Thyadra, which worshipped God,
beard us: whose heart the Lord
opened, that she attended unto the
things which were spoken of Paul
15 And when she was baptize^

^^TOW when they had passed
丄 、 through Amphipolis and Apol-
lon I as they came to ThessaIomd,
where was a synagogue of the Jews:
2 And Paul, as his manner was,
went in unto them, and three sabbath
day 5 reasoned with them out of the
Scriptures,
3 Opeiimgand: dleging, thatChrist
must needs have suffered, and risen
again from the dead; and that this
Je&us, whom I preach unto you s is
Christ.
4 And some of them belie wd, and
consortfid with Paul and Silas; and
of the devout Greeks a great multi-
tudq and of the cMef wotiien not a
few.
5 ¶ But the Jews which believed
not, moved with etivy, took unto
them certain lewd fellows of the baser
sort, and gathered a coinpany, and
set ah the cUy on an uproa!、and
assaulted the house of Srbou, and
sought to bring them out to the
people.
6 And when they found them not,
they drew Jason and certain brethren
unto tlse nileTS of the city, crying,
These that have turned the world
upside down are come hither also;
7 Whom Jason hath received: and
these all do contrary to the decrees
of Cesar, artying that there is another
one Jesus.
8 And they troubled the people
and the rulers of the city, when they
heard these things.
9 And when they had taken security
of'day on, and of the others, they let
them go r

ACTS, XVII-
11 These were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word withi all readiness
of mind, and searched the Scriptures
daily, whether those things H f ere so,
12 Therefore many of them believ-
ed;also of honctutable women which
were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
13 But when the Jews of Thcs-
salonicfi had knowledge that tire word
of Godpreached of Paul at
Berea, they came thither also and
stirred up-the people,
14 And then immediately the
brethren sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea: but Silas and Timo-
thy en abode there still.
15 And they that conducted Paul
brought him unto Athens: and re-
ceiving a oominantlment unto Silas
and Timotheiis for to come to him
with all speed, they departed.
16  Now while Paul waited for
them at AthenSj, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city wholly
given to idolatry.
17 Therefore disputed he in the
synagogue with the J^wk, and with
the devout person% and in the market
daily with them that met with him.
18 Then certain philosophers of
the Epicureans, and of the Stoics,
encountered him. And some 抑吨
What will this babbler say, other
some He seemeth to be a setter forth
of strange gods: because he preached
onto them Jesus and theregarrectian.
19 And they took him t and brought
him unto Aveopngos, sayings May we
know what this new doctrine, whereof
thou speakest, is t
20 For thou brmgest cer tain sirnnge
things to out ears r we would know
therefore what these things mean.

to tell or to hear some new thing.)

22 Then Paul stood in the midst
of Mar, hill, and J, aid, Ye men of
Ath(,os, I perceive that in all things
ye are too superstitious,
23 For as I passed by, and behold
your devotions, I found an altar
with thia inscription, To THE
UNKNOWN GOD, Whom there-
fore ye ignorautly worship him
dceliire I unto you,
24 God that made the world and
all things theren seeing that; he is
Lord of heaven and earth, Jwelleth
not in temples made with hands;
25 Neither is worshipped with
hands, as though he needed
suiy thing, seeing he giveth to all
life, and breath, and all things;
2 ¶ And hath inado of ono Wood
all nations of men for to dwell on all
the lace of the earth, and hath deter-
rained the times befeue appointed,
and the bounds of their habitation;
27 That they should seek the Lord,
if haply they might feel after him,
and find him though he be not far
from every one of us:
c 2H For in him we live, and move,
and have our being; as certain also
of your own poets have said, For we
are also his offspring.
20 Porasiniick then as we are the
offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto
gold, or silver, or stone, graven by
art awd man’s device,
30 And the times of this ignorance
God winked at; but now commuadeth
ftll men every where to repent:
31 Because he hath appointed a
day, in the which ha will judge the
world in righteougnc by that msm
whom h& hath ordained; whereof he
hath given assurance unto all men In
that he hath raised him Stom the dead.
32 ¶ And when they heard of the
resurrection of the dead, sonm moek-
ed: and others said, We will hear
thee again of this matter.

deputy of Acliaia, the Jews made
insurrection with one accord against
Paul and brought him to the indff-
ment seat,
13 Saying, Chis fellow persuadeth
men to worship God contrary to the
law.
14 And when Paul was now about
to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong
or wicked lewdness^o ye Jews, reason
would that I should bear with you:
15 But if it be a question of words
and names, and of your law, look ye
to it / for I will be no judge of such
matters,
16 And he drava them from the
judgment seat
17 Then all the Greeks took
Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
synagogue, and beat him before the
judgment seat. And Gallio cared
for none of those thin 私

his leave of the brethren l and sailed
thence into Syria, a tad with him

his head in Cenelirea: for he had a

4 Then said Paul, John verily
baptised with the baptism of repent-
ance, saying unto the people, that
they should believe on him which
sboiild come after luni, that is, on
Christ Jesus,
5 'VIIen they heard this, they were
baptized in theiiameof the Tjord Jesus.
6 And when Panl had laid his
hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
came on them; and they spake with
tonguos, and prophesied,
7 And all the men W6ro about
twelve.
8 And went intethe synagogue,
and spake boldly for tire space of
three months disputing and per-
suading the things concerning the
kingdom of God,
9 But when divers were hardened,
and believed not, but spake evil of
that way before the multitude, he
departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the
school of one Tyrannus,
10 And this continued foy the space
of two years; so that all they which
dwelt in Asia heard the word of the
Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
11 And God wrought special mi-
racles by the hands of Paul:
12 So that from his body were
brought unto the sick h and kerchiefs
or aprons, and the diseases departed
from them and the ovil spirits weat
out of them.
13 ¶ Then certain of I the vagabond
Jews; esorcisfs, took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits
the name of the Lord Jesus, saying,
We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul
preach eth,
14 And there were seven sons of
one Sewa, a Jew 5 and chief of the

16 And the man in whom the evil
spirit was leaped on them, and over-
came them, and prevailed against
them, so that they fleti out of that
house naked and wounded.
17 And this was known to all the
Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephosns l and fear fell on them all,
and the nfime of the Lord Jesus was
magnified •
18 And many that believed came,
and confessed, and shewed their
d 归 eds.
19 Many of them also which used
curious arts brought their books to-
gether, and burned them before all
men: and they counted the price of
them, and found it fifty thongand
pieces of silver.
20 So mightily grew the word of
God and prevailed,
2 lTf After these things were ended,
Paul purposed in the spirit, when he
Jmd passed through Macedonia, and
Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying,
After I have been there, I must also
see Eomo.
22 So he sent into Macedonia two
of them that ministered unto him,
Timotheus and Erast us, but he him-
self stayed in Asia for a season.
23 And the same time there arose
no small stir about that way.
24 For a certain man named De-

said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft

27 So that not only this our craft
is in clanger to be sot at nought; but
also that the temple of the great
goddess Diana should be despised,
and her magnificence should be de-
stroyed whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth.
28 And when they heard these
saying thev were fall of wrath, and
cried out, saying, Great h Diana of
the Ephesians,
29 And the whole city was filled
with confusion i and having caught
Gaiua and Aristarchus, men of Mace-
donia > Pa u Fa cam pan ions in travel,
they rushed with one accord into the
theatre.
30 And when Paul would haves
entered in unto the people, the disal-
plea suffered him not
31 And certfilii of the chief of Asia,
which wore his friends, sent unto-
him, desiring him that Llo would not
adventure himself into the theatre,
32 Some therefore cried one things
and worne another: for the assembly
was confused; and the more part
knew not wherefore they were come
together^
33 And they drew Alexander out
of the multitude, the -Tews putting
him forward. And Alexander btfek-
cried with the hand, and would have
macle his defence unto the people.
34 But when they knew that he
was a Jew all with one voice about
the space of two hours cried out.
Great is Diana of the Ephesians,
35 And when the town clerk had
appeased the people, he said, Ye men
of Epiiesus, what man is there that
knoweth not how that the city of the
Ephesians is fi worshipperof the great
gwrldess Diana, and of the imag&
which fell dawn from Jupiter,

be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

kw is open, and there are deputies:
let them implead one another,
39 But if ye inquire any thing

departed, for to go into Macedonia,
2 And when he had gone over

5 And when, we had accomplished
those days, we departed and went our
way, and they all broaght us on our
way with wives and children, till we
were out of the city; and we kneeled
dowtt on the shore, and prayed.
6 And when we had taken our
leav^i one o ' another, we took ship,
and they returned home again.
7 ind when we had finished our
course from Tyre, we came to Ftole-
and saluted the brethren, and
abode with them one day.
8 And the next day we that were
of Paul’s company depaxted^and came
iintoCesarea; and we catered into the
house of Philip the evaDgelist, which
was one of the seven; and abode with
him.
9 And the same man had four
daughter virgins, which did pro-
phrsy.
10 And in we tarried there many
days, ther came down from Judea a
certain prophet-, uamed Agabos,
11 An<I when he was come unto
he look Paul’s girdle, and bound
his own hands and ftet, and said,
Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man
that owneth this girdle, and 户 all
deliver him into the hands of the
Gentiles,
12 And when we heard these
things both we, and they of that
place, besought him not to go up to
JerasaleDu
13 Then Paul answered, Wiiat
mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart, for I am ready not to be bound
only, hut also lo die at Jerusalem for
the name of the fjord Jesus.
14 And wheti he would not be
persuaded, we ccased, saying, The
will of the Lord be dope.
15 And after those days we took
up our carriages> and went op to
Jerusalem.

16 There went with as also certain
of the disciples of Cesarea) and
brought with them one Mnasou of
Cjpnis, all oM disciple, with whom
we should lodge,
17 And when we were come to
Jerusalem, the brethren received us
gladly.
18 And the day following Paul
went in with us unto James;and all
the elders were present,
19 And when he had saluted them,
he dec! a led particularly what things
God had wrought among the Gen-
tiles by his ministry^
20 And when they heard il, they
glorified the Lord, and said unto
Thou s&est, brother, how many
thou sand & of Jews there are which
believe; and they are all zealous of
th 会 law i
21 And they are Informed of thee,
that thou teachesfe all the Jews which
are among the Gentiles to forsake
Moses, saying that they might not to
circumcise their children neither to
walk after the customs.
22 What is it therefore, the and-
titude must needs come together: for
they will hear that thou art come.
123 Do therefore this that we say
to thee: We have four men which
have a vow on them;
24 Them take, and purify thyself
with them, and be at charges with
their), that they may shave their
heads: and all may ktiow that those
things whereof they were itiformed
concerning thee, are nothing; but
that thou tTiyself also walkest orderly,
and deepest the law,
25 AS touching the Gentiles which
believe,we have written and con.
eluded that they observe no such
thing, save only iliat they keep
themselves from things offered to
idols, and from biood, and from
strangled, and from fornication.

2() Then Paul took tim meo, and
the next flay purifying himself with
them entered into the teniple, to
signify the accomplishment of the
days of purification, until that in\
offering should be offered for every
of them,
27 And when tlsfl seven days were
almost ended, the Jews which were
of Asia, when they saw him in the
temple, stirred up all the people and
laid baiKls on him,
28 Crying out. Men of Israel help:
This is the mm\ f that teacheth all wn
every where against the people, and
the law, and this place: and further
brought Greeks also into the temple,
and Irnth polluted this holy place,
2d (For they had soen before with
hiin in the city Trophimus an Ephe-
siao, whom they supposed that Paul
had brought into the temple.)
30 And all the city was moved, and
the people ran together: and t)iey took
Paul, and drew him out of tlae t&mplei
and forthwith the doors were shut.
Si And as they went about to kill
him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the batid that all Jerusalem-
lem was in au uproar:
32 Wlso immediately took soldiers
and centurions and nm down unto
them: and when they saw the chief
caphiiii and the soldiers, they left
beating: of Paul
33 Then the chief captain came
near, and took him, and commanded
him to be bound with two chains;
and demamkd who he way, and what
he had done,
34 And some cried one theng, some
another, among the multitude: and
when he could not know the cerUmty
for the he commanded him
to be carried into the castle.
35 And when he came upon the
stairs, so it was, that he was borne

3 ¶ For the multitude of the people
followed after, crying. Away with
him,
37 And as Paul was to be led into
the castle, he said unto the chief
captain. May I spak unto thee,
Who said, Canst thou speak Greek,
38 Art not thou that Egyptian,
which before these ciays madest an
uproar, and leddest out into the
wilderneas four thoiisand men that
were murderers,
39 But Paul said, I am a man
which am a Jew ofTarsu a <my in
Cilicia, a eitizen of no mean city: and,
I beseech thee suffer me to spoak
unto the people.
40 And when he had given him
license, Paul stood on the stairs and
beckoned with the band unto the
people. And when there was made
a great silence, he spake unto them in
the Hebrew tongue, saying,
CHAPTER XXII.
/FEN, brethren, and fathora, hear
VI ye my defence which I maks
now unto you.
2 (And when they heard that he
spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
they kept the more silence: and he
saithj)
3 L am verily a man which am a
JeW, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilieia,
yet brought tip in this city at the feet
of Gamaliel, and taught according to
the perfect manner of the law of the
fathers, and \mn zealous toward God,
as ye all are this day.
4 And J persecuted this way unto
the death, binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women.
5 AS also the high priest doth bear
me witness and all the estate of the
elders: from whom also I received
letters unto the brethren  and went to
Damascus, to bring them which were
there bound unto Jerusalem, for to
be punished.

10 And I said, What shall I do,
Lord, And the Lord said unto me,
Arii,e, and go into Damascus] and
there it shall be told thee of all things
which are appointed for thee to do.
11 And when I could not see for
the glory of that light, being led by
the hand of them that were with nie,
I came into Paraascus,
12 And one Ananiy r devout
man according to the law, having a

law, and commandest me to be
smitten cantraiy to the law,

Revikst thou God's high priest,
5 Then said Paul, I wist not,
brethren, that he was the high priest:
for it is written Thoa slmu not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
6 But when Paul perceived that
the one part were Sadducees, and the
other Phiirisees, he cried oat fa the
council, Men and brethren, I am a
Pharisco, the son of a Pharisee: of
the hope and restirrection of the

10 And when there mrose a great
dissension, the chief captaiu, fearing
lest Paul should have been palled
in pieces of them, commanded the
eokliers to go down, and to take him
by force from among them, and to
bring him into the castle,
11 And the night following the
Lord stood by him # and said, Be of
good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast
testified of me in Jerusalem, so must
thou bear witness also at Borne,
12 And when it was day, certaui of
the Jews banded together, and bound
themselves under a curse, saying that
they would neither eat nor drink till
they had killed Paul
13 And they were more than forty
which had made this conspiracy,
14 And they came to the chief
priests and elder and said, We have
bound ourselves under a great corse,
that we will eat nothing until we
have alaio Pau!.
15 Now therefore ye with the
council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to
morrow as tiimigh ye would inquire
something more perfectly concerning
him: and we, or ever he come
are ready to ldll him.
16 And when PatiFS sister son.
heard of their lying in wait he went
and catered into the castle, and told
Paul.
17 Then Paul called one of the
centurions unto him, and said, Bring
this young man unto the chief captain:
for helmth a certain thing to tell him.
18 So he took iiica, and brought
him to the chief captaxn, and said,
Paul the prisoner called me unto him,
and prayed me to bring this young
man unto thee who hath something

20 And he said, The Jews have
agreed to desire thee that thou would-
est bring down Paul to morrow into
the council; as though they would in-
quire somewhat of him mare perfetly,
21 But da not thou yieM unto
them: fer there he in wait for him of
them more than forty men, which
have bound themselves with an oath,
that they will neither eat nor drmk
till they have killed him: and now
are they reoxly, looking for a promise
from thee.
22 So the dhief captain then let
the young man depart, and charged
him t See thou tdl no man that the'a
hast shewed these things to me.
23 And he called unto him two
centtirioiis, sayings Make read, two
hundred soldiers to go to Cesar
and horsemen threescore and ten, and
spearmen two hundred at the third
hour of the night;
24 And provide them beasts, that
they may set Paul on, and bring him
safe unto Felix the governor.
25 And he wrote a letter after this
manner:
26 Claudius Lysias unto the most
excellent governor Felix sendeth
greeting.
27 This mai) was taken of the
Jews, and should have been killed of
them: then came I with an army,
and rescued him, having understood
that he was a Roman.
28 And when I would have known
the eansG wh(mfV>re they accused him,
I brought him forth Into their council:
29 Whom I perceived to be ac-
cused of questions of their kw, but
to have nothing laid to his d'nrge
worthy of denth or of bonds.
30 And when it was told me how
that the Jews laid wait for the man f
I sent straighhva, to thee, and gave
comnmnclment to his accusers also to
say before thee what they had against
him. Farewell.

7 But the chief captain Lysias
CEme upon us and with great violeace
took him away out of our Ijatid^
8 Commanding his accusers to come
unto thee: by examining of whom
thyself ruayest take knowledge of all
these thing.% whereof we accDse him.
9 And the Jews also a rented, joy-
ing that thss'o.things were sf).
10 Then Punl, after that the
governor had beckoned unto him to
sjX3ak; answered, Forasmnch i\s I
know that thou I last been of man,
yeurg a judge unto this nation, I do
the more cheerfully answer for myself;
11 Because that thou mayest un-
deifitam], that there are yet but
twelve since I ivent up to
Jerusalem fijr to worship,
12 And they neititer found me in
the temple disputing with any
neither raising up the people, neither
in the synagogue^, nor in the city:
13 Neither can they prove the
things wltereof they uow accuse me.
14 But this I confess unto thee,
that after the way which they call
heresy, go worship I the God of my
fathers; believing all things which
are witten in the law ned in the
prophets:
15 And have hopu toward God 3
which they themH;lves also allow,
that there shall be a resurreetion of
the dead, both of the just and unjust.
16 And herein do I exercise my-
self, to have always a eouscienai voic
of offence toward God, and toward
men,
17 Now after many years I came
to bring alms to my lmtiyii and
offerings.
18 Whe^reupoii certain Jews from
Asm found me purified in the temp I e;
neither with multitude, nor witk
tumult.
10 WIIo ought to have b^sen here

20 Or elm let these satue here my,
if they have found any evil doing in
me> while I stood before the ooundl,
21 Except it be for thia one voice
that I cried standing among them,
rou ch ing the resurrection of the dead
I am called in question by you this
day.
22 And when I^ciix heard these
things having more perfect know-
ledge of that way, he deferred them^
and said, When Lysias the dilcrcap-
tnin shall corue down, I will know
the uttermost of your matter.
23 And he commanded a centurion
to keep Paul, and to let him have
liberty, and that he should forbid
none of his acqTiaintancG to minister
or come unto him,
24 And after certain days, when
Pelix cume with his wife Drasilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul 7
and heard him concerning the faith
in Christ.
25 And as he reasoned of right-
eausLicss temperance and judgment
to come, Felix trembled, and au~
swered, Go thy way fi)r this time;
when I have a conveiiieni seasoii, t
will oail fur thee.
26 He hoped also that money
should have bcea given him of Paul,
that he might loose him: wherefore
he sent for him the ofleuer, and com-
rauned with him.
27 But after two years Porcius
Festua came into Felix’ room: and
Fdix, willing to shew the Jews ^
pleasure left Paul boimtL
CHAPTER XXX.
1 NOW when Festus was come into
the pTovincC, after three days
he ascended from Cesarea to Jeiusa-

3 And desired favour against him,
that he would gend for him to
Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to
kill him.
4 But Fastns answered, that Paul
should he kept at Cesarea, and
that he him self would depart shortly
thither.
5 Let the eh therefore, said he,
which among you are able go down.
with 慨, and accuse tills nuai, if there
be any wickedness in him.
6 And when he had tarried among
them more than ten days, he went
down unto Cesitren; and the nest day
sitting on the judgment ' seat com-
manded Paul to be brought.
7 And when he was come, the Jews
which came down from Jerusalem
stood round about, and laid many
and grievous complaints against Paul,
which they could not prove.
8 While he answered for himself,
Neither against the law of the Jews,
neither against the temple) nor yet
against Cesar, have I offended any
thing at all
9 But Festu willing to do the
Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem,
and there be judged of these things
before me,
10 Then said Paul, I stand at
Cesar's, judgment seat, where I ought
to be judged: to the Jews have I done
no wrong, as thou very well knowest,
11 For if I be an offender, or have
committed any thing worthy of death,
I refuse not to die: but if there be
none of these things whereof these
accuse me, no man may deliver me
unto them. I appeal unto Cesar.
12 Then Festus when he had
conferred with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Cesar, unto
Cesar shalt thou go,
13 And after certain days king
Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Cesarea to salute Festus.

14 And when they had been there
many days, Festus d coin red PauPS
cause unto the king, saying, There
h  certain man left in bonds by-
Felix:
15 About Avhom, when I was at
Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
elders of the Jews informal me, Jasir-
ing to have judgment against him.
16 To whom I answered, it is not
the maimer of the liomans to driver
any man to cliG, before that he which
is accused have the accusers &ce to
face, and have licence to answer for
himself concerning the crime lriId
against him.
17 Therefore, vhe【i they wore come
hither without any delay on the mor-
row I sat on the judgment seat, and
commanded the man to be brought
forth.
18 Against whom lylienthe accusers
stood up, they brought none accusa-
tion of such things as I supposed:
19 i>nt had certain questions
against him of thetr own superstition,
and of one Jesus, which was <lead,
whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
20 And because I doubted of Biich
manner of questions, I asked him
whether he Tvould go to Jerusalem,
and there be judged of these matters,
21 But when Paul had apijealed
to be reserved unto the hearing of
Augustus, I commanded him in be

Thou art permitted to speak for

ACTS, XXXI,
7 Unto which promise our twelve
tribes, instantly serving God day and
night, hope to come. For which
hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews.
8 Why should it be thought a
thing incredible with you f that God
63 ¶ Id r 具 ise the dead,
9 I verily thought with myself,
that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of
Nazareth.
10 Which thing I also did in
Jerusalem: and many of the sftiata

authority from the chief priests,
and when they were put to death, I
gave in, voice against them,
11 And I punished them oft in
every synagogue and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceeding-
ly mad against them I persecuted
them even unto strange cities.
12 Whereupon as I went to Da-
mascus with authority and commis-
sion from the chief priests,
13 At midday, O king, I saw hi
the way a light from heaven, above
the brightness of the land, shining
round about me and them 'which
journeyed with me.
14 And when we were all fallen to
the earth, I heard a voice speaking
unto me, and saying in the Hebrew
tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me, it is bard for thee to kick
against the pricks,
15 And I said, Who art thou,
Lord, And he said, I am Jesus
whom thou persecutest.
16 But rise, and stand upon thy
feet: for I have appeared unto thee
for this purpose, to make thee my
minister and a witness both of these
things which thou hast seen, and of

17 Delivering d iee from the people^
and from the Gentiles unto whom
now I send thee,
18 To open their eyes and to turn
them from darkness to lights and from
the power of Satan unto God; that
they may receive forgiveness of sins,
and inheritance amotig them which
are sanctified by faith that is in me.
19 Whereupon, o king Agrippa I
was not disobedient unto the heaven-
ly vision,
20 But shewed first unto them of
Damascus, and at Jerusalem r and
through out all the coasts of Judea,
and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent and turn to Go«3, and
do works meet for repentance,
21 For these causes the Jews
caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill 獅 .
22 Having therefore obtained help
of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great,
saying none other things than those
which the prophets and Moses did
gay should come:
23 That Christ should suffer, and
that he should be the first that should
rise from the dead; and should shed
light unto the people, and to the
Gentiles,
24 And in he thus spake for him-
sell; Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art Ix^ide thyself; much
learning doth make thee mad.
25 But he said, I am not mad,
most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness.
26 For the king knoweth of these
things, before whom also I speak
freely, for I am persuaded that none
of these things lire hidden from him;
for this thing was not done in a
corner.

28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul,
Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian,
29 And Paul said, I would to God
thru: not only thou, but also all that
hear me tills day; were both almost,
and altogether such as I am, except
these bonds.
30 And when he had thus spoken,
the king rose up, and the governor, and
Bern ice, and they that sat with them:
31 And when they were gone aside
they talked between themselves, say-
ing, This man doeth nothing worthy

3 And the next day we touched at
Sidon. And Julius courteously en-
treated Paul, and gave him liberty to
go unto his friends to refresh himself
4 And when we had launches from
thence, we sailed under Cyprus, be 』
cause the winds were contrary.
5 And when ㈣ had sailed over
the sea of Cilicia and Paiupliylia we
came to Myra, a city of Ljciii,
6 And there the ceriturion found
a s^hip of Alesanclriit sailing into

8 And, hardly passing it, came
unto a place which is called the Fair
Havens; nigh whereunto was the
city of Lasea.
9 No r when mi)oh time was spent,
and when sailing was now dangerous,
because the fnst was now already
past f Paul admonished them'
10 And said onto them, Sirs, I
perceive that this voyage will be
with luirt and much damage, not
only of the lading and ship, l)ut also
of our lives.
11 Nevertkeless the centurion be-
lieved the mastef and the owner of
the ship, more than thosD things
which were spoken by Paul,
12 And because the haven was not
commodious to winter in, the more
part advised to depart thence also,
if by any means they might attain to
Phenioe, and there to winter; which
is a haven of Crete, and lieth toward
the southwest and northwest.
13 And when the south wind blew
softly, supposing that they had ob-
tained their purpose loosing t!ienee,

14 But not long after there arose
against it a tem ^estuoiis wind, called
Euroclydoa,
15 And when the sliip was canght,
and could dof bear up into the wind,
we let her drive.
16 And rumiing under a certain
island which is called Clauda, we had
much work to come by the bout ^
17 Which when they had fakm
up, they used 1]elps, undergivding
the ship; and, fearing lest they
should fall into the fjuiciksancla,
strakc saii, and so were driven,
18 And we being exceedingly
to^ed with a tempest, the nest day
they lightened the ship;
19 And the third day we cast out
with our own haiicls the tackling of
the ship.

ACTS, XXVII
20 And when neither sun nor stars
in many dii vs appeared, and no small
tempest lay on all hope that ^\e
si i on Id be saved was then taken away +
21 But after long abstinence, Paul
stood forth in the midst of them, and
said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened
unto me, and not Iiavo loosed from
Crete, and to have gained this harm
and loss.
22 And now I exhort you to be of
good cheer: for there shad be no loss
of any man, s life among voii, but of
the ship,
23 For there stood by me this
night the angel of God, whose I am,
and wboni I mr\t,
24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou
must be brought before Cesar t and,
lo God hath given thee all them that
sail with thee.
25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good
cheer: for I bslleve God, that it shall
be even aa it was told me
26 Howbeit we must be cast upon
a certain island.
27 But when the fourteoiith night
was come as we were driven up and
down in A/lrja, about midnight the
shipnien deemed that they drew near
to 即 me cotiatry;
28 And sounded, and found it
twenty fathoms: and when they had
gone a little fur the i t, they sounded
again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
29 Then fearing lest we should
ImYt fallen upon rocks, they cast four
anchors out of the stern, and willed
for the day,
30 And as the shipmen were about
to flee out of the ship, when they had
let down the boat into the sea, micler
colour as though they would have
cast anchors out of the foreship^
Sl^Paul said to the centurion and
to the soldiers Except these abide in
the ship, ve cannot be saved.
32 Then the soldiers cut off the
ropes of the boat, anfl let her fait off.

33 And while the day was coming
on, Paul besought them all to take
meat, saying, Tins day is the four-
teentL day that ye have tarried
and continued fasting having taken
JXOthlDg,
34 Wherefore J pray you to take
⑽ me meat; for this is for your health:
for there shall not a hair fall from
the head of any of you.
35 And when he had thus spok _,
he took breads and gave thanks to
God in presence of them dl; and
Tv f hea be had broken it the began
to eat.
36 Then were they all of good
cheer, and they also took smie meat
37 And we were in all in the ship
two hundred threescore and sixteen
souls,
38 And when they had eaten
enough, they lightened the ship, and
cast out the wheat into the nea.
33 And when it was day, they
knew not the land: but they dis-
covered a certain creek with a shore;
into the which they were mmded, if
it were possible, to thrust la the ship.
40 And when they had taken up
the ancliors, they committed them-
selves unto the sea, and loosed the
rudder banrls and hoised up the
mainsail to theand iiiadc to-
ward shore,
41 And falling into a place where
two seas met, they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast,
and remained immoveable but the
hinder part was broken witL the vio-
lence of the wa ves.
42 And the soldiers, counsel was
to kill the prisoners, lest any of them
should swim out, and escape.
43 But the centurion, willing to
save Paul, kept them from their pm%
pose; and commanded that they which
could sw, ni should cast themsehes
first into the sea, and get to land:

And so if came to pass, that they
escaped all safe to land,
CHAPTER XXVIII.
1 AND when they were escaped,
then they knew that the island
■was called Melita.
2 And the barbarous people shewed
as no little kindness: for they kindled
a fire, and received us every one,
because of the present mm, and be-
cause of the cold.
3 And when I > aoI had gathered a
bundle of sticky, and laid them oq the
lire, there came a viper out of the
heat, and fastened on his hand,
4 And when the barbarians saw
the venortious beast hang on his hand,
they said among themselves, ITo doubt
this manis a murderer, whom, though
he hath escaped the sea, jet ven-
geance suffereth not to live.
5 And he shook off the beast into
the flre, and felt no harm.
6 Howbeit they looked when he
should have swolieti, or fallen down
dead suddenly: but after they had
looked a great while, and saw no harm
come to hiru, they changed their
iainds, and said that he was a god
7 In the same quarters were pos-
sessions of the chief man of the island,
whose name was PubHus; who re-
ceived us and lodged us three days
courteously.
8 And it came to pass, that the
father of Publius lay sick of a fever
and of a bloody Hux: to whom Paul
entered in, and prayed and laid his
Lands on and healed him.
9 So whe,a this was doue 5 others
also, which had diseases in the island,
name, and were healed:
10 W1 in also honoured us with many
honours: and when we departed, they
laded us with such things as were
necessary.

11 And after three months we
departed in a ship of Alexandria,
trliieh had wintered in the isle whose
sign was Castor and Pollux,
12 And landing at Syracuse, we
tarried there three days.
13 And from thence we fetched a
eompass, and came to Khegium: and
after one day the south wind bleW,
and we came the next day to Puteoh:
14 Where we found brethren and
were desired to tarry with them seven
days: and so we went toward home.
15 And from thence, when the
brethren heard of us, they came to
meet us as far as Appil Forum, and
the Three Taverns; whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God and took
courage,
16 And when we came to Borne,
the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard: but Paul
was suffered to dwell by himself with
a soldier that kept him.
17 And it csnie to pass, that after
three days Paul called the oliiefof the
Jews together: and when they were
come together jhe said imtethem, Men
and brethren, though I have commit-
ted nothing against the people or
customs of our fathers, yet was I
delivered prisoner from Jerusalem
into the hands of the Romans:
18 Who, wheD they hati examined
me, would have let me go, because
there was no eaiise of death in me.
19 But when the Jews spake
against it f I was constrained to appeal
unto Cesar; not that I bad aught to
accuse my: nation of.
20 For this cause therefore have I
called for you, to se« and to speak
with you: because that for the hope
of Israel I am bound with this chain,
21 And they said unto him, We
neither received letters out of Judea
concerning the% neither any of the
brethren that came shewed or spake
any harm of thee.

this sect, we know that every where
it is spoken against,
23 4nd when they had appointed
him a day, there came many to him
into his Jogging; to whom he ex-
pounded and testified the kingdom of
God, persuading them concerning
Jesus, both out of the law of Moses,
out of the prophets, from morn-
ing till evening.
24 And some believed the things
which were spoken, and some be-
lieved Dot,
25 And when they agreed notamong
themselves, they departed, after that
Paul had spoken one word) Well
spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the
prophet unto our fathers,
26 Saying, Go unto this people,
and say f Hearing ye shall hear, and
shall not understand; and seeing
ye shall see, and not perceive:
27 For the heart of this people is
waxed gross, and their ears are dull
of hearings and their eyes have they
closed; lest they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and
shonM be converted, and I should
heal them,
28 Ee it known therefore unto
you, that the salvation of God h
sent unto the (a-entilesj, and ihtd they
will hear it, .
2 ¶ And when he had said these
words, the Jews departed’ and had
great reasoning among themselves.
30 And Paul dwelt two whole
years in his own hired lions% and
received all that came in unto him,
31 Preaching the kingdom of God,
and teaching those things which
concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with
all confidence, no man forbidding

16 For I am not ashamed of the

also to the Greek-
17 For therein is ti ]e righteousness of
God revealed from faith to faith: aa it
is written, 'Jliejust shall live by faith,
18 For the wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness

neither were thankful; but became
vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened,

3 For what saith the Scripturiy,
Abraham believed God, and it was

4 Now to him that worketh is the
reward not reckoned of grace, but of
debt.
5 But to him that worketh not,
but belleveth on him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness^
6 Even as David also describeth
the blessedness of the man unto
whom God impnteth righteousness
without works,
7 Saying, Blessed are they who&e
iniquities jug forgivert, and whose
sins are covered +
8 Blessed is the man to whom the
Lord will not impute sin,

3 He then if, while her husband
liveth, sUe be married to another
ma., she shall be called an adal-
teress: but if her husband be dead.
sbe is free from that law, so that
she is no adulteress, though she be
married to a t>other imn t
4 Wherefore my brethren, ye also
:\re become dead to the law by the
body of Oh l ist ' that ye should be
married to another, to him who
is raised from the dead, thaf; we
should bring forth fruit unto God.
5 For when we Tvere in the flesh r
the motions of sins, which were by
the law, did work in our members
to bring forth fruit unto death,
6 But now we are delivered from
the law, that being tlcad wherein we
were held; that we should serve in
oewness of spirit, and not in the
oldness of the letter.
7 What filial I we say then, IS
the law sin, God forbid, Nay, I
had not known but by the law i
for I had not known last, except the
law had said, Than shalt not covet
8 But &in, taking occasion by the
commamlment, wrought in me all
marmer of concupiBccnce, For with-
out the law sin was dead,
9 For I was alive without the
law oncei but when the command-
ment came, dn revived, and I died.
10 And the commtmdmeiit, which
ordmned to life, I found to be
unto deatlu
11 For taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me.

For the good that I would, I
do not: but the evil which I would

20 Now if I do that I would no%
it is no more I that do it, but mn

21 I find then a law, when I

22 Por I delight in the law of
God after the inward man:
23 But I see another law in my

who shal! deliver me from the body

3 Wov what the law could not do,
in that it was weak through the
flesh, God sending his own Bon in
the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
sin condemned sm in the flesh:
4 That the righteousness of the law
Hiight be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
5 For they that are after the flesh
do mind the things of the flesh; but
they that are after the Spirit, the
things of the Spirit.
6 For to be carnally minded is
death; but to te spiritually minded
is life and peace.
7 Because the carnal mind is
enmity against God i for it is not
subject to the law of God; neither
indeed can be.
8 So then they that are in the
flesh cannot please God.
9 But ye are not 5a the flesh, but
in t^e Spirit, if so be that the Spirit
of God dwell in you. Now if any
man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his,
10 And if Christ b6 in jon, the
body i& dead because of sin; but the
Spirit is life because of righteousness,
11 But if the Spirit of him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
in you, he that raised up Christ from
the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you.
12 Therefore, brethTen > we are
debtors, not to the flesh, to live after
the flesh.
13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye
shall die i but if ye through the
Spiiit do mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live.
14 For as many I as are led by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons
ot God,

spirit of bondage again to fear; but
ye have received the Spirit of ad op-
tion, whereby w<- cry, Abba, Father%

16 The Spirit itself beareth witness
with our spirit, that we are the chil-
dren or God:
17 And if children then heirs;
heirs of God, and joint heirs with
Christ; if so be that we suffer with
him, that we may be also glorified
together,
18 For I reckon that the sufferings
of this present time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory which
shall be revealed in us.
19 For the earnest expectation of
the creature waiteth for the manifes-
tation of the sons of God.
20 For the creature was made
subject to vanity, not wlHingly, but
by reason of him who hath subjected
the same in hope;
21 Because the creature itself also
shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption into the glorious liberty
of the cbUdrtiii of God,
22 For we know that the whole
creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now,
23 And not only they, but ourselves
also which have the first fruits of
the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
within ourselves, waiting for the
adoption, to wit, the redemption of
our body.
24 For we are saved by hope: but
hope that is seen is not hope: for
what a man eeeth, why doth he yet
hope for,
25 But if we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for it
26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth
our infirmities: for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought:
but the Spirit itself maketh inter-
for us with groanings which
ca I mot be uttered.
27 And he that aearcheth the
hearts knoweth what is the mind of
the Spirit because be maketh inter-
cession for the saints according to
the will of God.

28 And wt, know that all things

love God, to than who are the called
according to his purpose.
29 For whom he did foreknow, he
also did predestinate to be conformed
to the itoRge of hlfi Son, that he
might be the first-born among nmny
brethren.
30 More over, whom he did j, redes-
tinate, them he also called: and
whom he oalled, them he also justi-
find, and whom he justified, them
he also glorified,
31 What shall we then say to
these things, Lf God be for us, who
can be against us,
32 He that spared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for us: al ],
how shall he not with him also freely
give as all things,
33 Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of God's elect, It is God
that justifieth,
34 Who is he that condemneth,
It is Christ that died, yea rather^
that is rison again, who fs even at
the right band of God, who nho
maketh intercession for us.
35 Who shall a rate us from the
love of Christ, ahull tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword,
36 AS it is written, For thy sake
we are killed all the day long;
we are ftccounted as sheep for the
slaughter,
37 Kay In all these things we
ate more than oonquerora through
him that loved os.
38 For I am pei saaded, that neither
deftth, nor life, nor angels, iior princi-
pal ities, nor powers, nor things pres-
ent, nor things to come,
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature shall be ubk to
separate us from die love of God,
which is in Oirat Jesus our Lord.

6 But the righteousness whid,

not in thinft heart, Who shall ascend

7 Or y Who shall descend into the
deep, (that is, to bring ttp Christ

8 But what saith it, The word is
nigh thee, even in thy raouth, and in

which we preach;
9 That if thou shalt confess with
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thitie heart that God hath
raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved
10 For with the heart man be-
he veth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confession is made unto
salvation.
11 For the Scripture saitk, Who-
soever believeth on him shall not be
ashamed,
12 For there is no difference
between, the Jew and the Greek: for
the paitie Lord over all is rich unto

19 But I say, Bid not Israel know,
First Moses saith, I will provoke
you to jealousy by them that are no
people, and by a foolish nation I will
anger you.
20 But Esaias in very bold, and
fearth, I ws found of them that sought
me not; I was made manifet unto
them that asked not after me.
21 But to Israel he saith, All <3ay
long I have stretched forth my hands
unto a disobedient and gainsaying
people.
CHAPTER XI
SAY then, Hath God cast away
his people, God forbid For I
also am nn IsiaeHte, of the seed of
Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God hath not cast away his
people which he foreknew- Wot ye
not what the Scripture salth of Elias,
how be maketh intercession to God
against Israel, saying,
3 Xiord, they have killed thy pro-
phols, and digged down thine altars;
and I am ldt al(>ne, and they seek
my life.
4 But whatsaith the answer of God
unto him, I have reserved to nijself
seven thousaiul men, who have not
bowed the knee to the image o/BaaL
5 Even so then at this present;
time also there is a remnant accord-
ing to the election of grace.
6 And if by grace,  it no
more of works: otherwise grace is no
mom grace, But if it be of works,
then is it no more graee: otherwise
work is no more work.
7 What then, Israel hath not
obtained that which he seeketh for;
but the election hath obtained it,
and the rest were blinded
8 (According as it is written, God
hath given them the spirit of slumber,
eyes that they should not see, and
carp that they should not hear;) unto

9 And David salth, Let their table

stumblingblock, and a recompense
unto them:
10 Let their eyes be clarkened I that

111 say then, Have they stumbled
that they should fall, God forbkl:
but rather through their fall salvation
is come unto the Gentiles, for to
provoke them to jealousy.
12 Now If the fall of them be the

be the reconciling of the world, what
Rkah d »e receiving of them be f but life

16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the

holy, so are the branches,
17 And if some of the branches be
broken off; and thou, being a wild

7 For none of us liveth to himself,

15 Nevertheless, brethren I have
written the more boldly unto you in
some sort, as putting you in mind
because of the grace that is given
to me of God,
16 That I should be the minister
of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, min-
Istening the gospel of God, that the
offering up of the Gentiles might be
acceptably being sanctified by the
Holy Ghost,
17 I have therefore whereof I may
glory through Jesus Christ in those
things which pertain to God.
18 For I will not dare to speak of
any of those things which Christ
hath not wrought by me, to make
the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed,
19 Through mightjaigns and won-
ders, by the power of the Spirit of
God; in that from Jerusalem, and
round about unto Jllyricum, I have
fully prenched the gospel of Christ.
20 Yea, so have I strived to preach
the gospel not where Christ was
named, lest I should build upon
another man’s foundation:
21 But as It is written, To whom
he was not spoken of, they shall see:
and they that have not heard shall
understand.
22 For which cause also I have
been much hindered from eoDiing
to you.
23 But now having no more place
in these parts, and having a great
desire these mfin, years to come
unto you;
24 Whensoever I lake my journey
into Spain, I will come to you: for f
trust to see you in ray journey, and
to be brought on my way thitherward
by you, if first I be somewhat filled
with your company.
25 But now I go unto Jerusalem
to miaister unto the saints.

26 For It hath }>led&ed them of

certain contribiition for the poor
saints which are at Jerusalem.
27 It hath pleased them verily;
and their debtors they are. For if
the Gentiles have bee a made par -

duty is also to minister unto them in
carnal things,
28 When therefore I have per-
formed this, and have sealed to them
this fruit, i will come by you into
Spain.
29 And I am sure that, when I
come unto you, I shall come in the
fuhiess of the blessing of the gospol

30 Now I beseech you, brethren,
for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
and 11)1: the love of the Spirit, iiiat
ye strive together with me in your
prayers to God for me J
31 That I may be delivered from
them that do not believe in Judea,

for Jerusalem may be accepted of

12 Now this I say, that every one
of you Baith, I am of Paul; and I
of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I
of Christ.
13 IS Christ divickd, was Paul
cruoifiod for you, or were ye baptized
in the name of Paul,
14 I thank God that I baptized
none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
15 lest any should say that I had
baptized in mine own name.
16 And I baptized also the house-
hold of Stephanas: besides, I know
not whether I baptised any other.
17 For Christ sent me not to
baptizes but to preach the gospel:
not with wisdom of words, lest the
cross of Christ should be made of
none effect,
18 For the preaching of the cross
is to them that perish, foolishness i
but onto us which are saved, it is the
power of God.
19 For it is written, I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise, and will
bring to nothing the understanding
of the prudent.
20 Where is the wise, where
the scribe, where is the disputer of
this world,hath not God made fooHsh
the wisdom of this world,
21 For after that in the wisdom
of God the world by wisdom knew
not, God, it pleased God by the fool-
ishness of preaching to save them
that believe.
22 For the Jews require a sjgo,
and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
23 But we preach Christ crudfkd,
unto the Jews a stumbIingbIock, and
unto the Greeks foolishness;
24 But unto them which are culled,
footh Jews and Greeks, Christ the
power of God, and the wisdom of
God k!
25 Because the foolishness of God
is wiser than men; and the weaklier
of God is stronger than men.

8 Which none of the princes of
this world knew: for liad they
known u, they would not have
erocified the Lord of glory.
9 But as it is written, Eye hath
not seeri, nor ear heard, neither have
entered mto the heart of man, the
things which God hath prepared
for them that love him.
10 But; God hath revealed them
unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
scarclieth all things, yea, the deep
things of God,
11 For what man knoweth the
things of a mati, gave the spirit of
man which is in him, even so the
things of God knoweth no man but
the Spirit of God t
12 Now we have received, not the
spirit of the worlds but the Spirit
which is of God; that we might
know the things that are freely
given to us of God.
13 Which things also we speak,
not In the words which mati's wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
teacheth; comparing spiritual things
with spiritual,
14 But the natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God:
for fhci, are foolishness onto him:
neither can he know them t because
they are spiritually ch seemed.
15 But he that is spiritual judgeth
all things, yet he himself is judged
of no man,

16 Kdow ye not that ye are the
temple of God and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you,
17 If siny man defile the tom pie of
God, him shall God destroy; for the
temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are.
18 Let no r:mu deceive himself. If
any man among you seen^eth to be
wise in this world, let him become a
foo], that he may be wise.
19 For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God: for it is written,
He taketh the wise is their own
craftiness,
20 And a gain, The Lord knoweth
the thoughts of the wise, that they
are vain,
21 Therefore let no man glory in

5 And these things, brethren, I
have in a figure transferred to myself
to A poll os for your sakes; that ye
might learn in us not to think of men
above that which is wnttcn that no
one, of you be puffed up for o ⑽
against another,
7 For who maketh thee to differ
from another f and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive, now
if thou didst receive why dost
glory, as if thou hadst not
received it t
8 Now ye are foll now ye are rich,
ye have reigned as kings without us:
and I would to God ye did reign that
we also might reign with you,
9 For I think that God hath set
forth us the apostles last, as it were
appointed to death: far we are made
a spectacle unto the world and to
angels, and to men.
10 We are fools fer Chrises sake,
but ye are wise in Christ  we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are
iionourable but we are despised.
11 Even unto this present hour
we both hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are buifeted, and have no
certain dwelling place;
12 And labour, working with our
o'a hands: being reviled, we bless;
being persecuted, we safer it:
13 Being defamed, we entreat: we
are made as the filth of the world,
and are the offscouring of all things
unto this day.
14 I write not these things to
slmme you, but as my beloved sons I
ward you
15 For though ye have ten thou-
santi instructors in Christ yet have
not many fathers: for in Christ
I have begotten you through
the gcjspeL
16 Wherefore I beseech you, be
ye followers of me.

or a drunkard or an extortioner;
with such a one no not to eat.
12 Por what have I to do to judge
them also that are without, do not
ye judge them that are within,
13 But them that are without God
jtidgeth. Therefore put away from

3 Know ye not that we shall, udge

25 Now concerning virgins I have
no commandment of the Lord; yet
I give my judgment, as one that
Mth obtaine^l mercy of the Lord to
be faith ful
26 I suppose therefore that this is
good for the present distress, J sai/ f
that u is good for a man so to be.
2 ¶ Art thou bound unto a wife,
seek not to be loosed. Art thou
loosed from a wife, seek not a wife,
28 But and if thou marry, thou
hast cot sinned; and if a virgin
marry, sbe hath not sinned. Never-
theleas such shall have trouble in the
flesh: but I spare you.
29 But this I say, brethren the
time is short: it remaineth that both
they that have wives be as though
they had none;
30 And they that weep, as though
they wept not; and they that rejoice,
as though they rejoiced not, and
they that buy, as though they pos-
sessed no t;
31 And they that use this world’
as not abusing it: for the fashion of
this world passeth away,
32 But I would have you wiiliout
carefulness. He that in unmarried
caret!i for the things that belong to
the Lord, how he may please the
Lord;
33 But he that is married eareth
for the things that are of the world;
how he may please his wife.
34 There is difference aim between
a wife and a virgin. The unmarried
woman careth for the things of the
Lord, that she may be holy both in
body and in spirit: but she that is
married careth for the thiags of the
world, how she may please her
hlisbund,
35 And this I speak for your own
profit; not that I may cast a snare
upon you, but for that which is
comely and that ye may attend upon
the Lord without distraction.

OW as touching things offered
IN unto idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge puifeth
up, but charity edifieth,
2 And if any man think that he
hDOweth any thing, he knoweth no-
thing yet as he ought to know.
3 But if any man love God > the
game is known of him,
4 AS concerning therefore the
eating of those things that are offered
in sacrifice unto idols, we know that
an idol is nothing in the world, and
that there is none other God but one,
5 For though there be that are
called gods, whether in heaven or in
earth, (as there be gods many, and
lords raany,
6 But to us there is but one God^
the Fathet, of whom are all things,
and we in him; and one Lord Jesus
Christ by whom are all things and
we by him.

7 Howbeit there is not In every

eat it a thing offered unto an idol;

to idols \
11 And through thy knowledge

I have a reward: but if against my

committed unto me,
18 What is my reward then,
Verily the when I preach the gospel,
X may make the gospel of Christ
without d]arge, that I abuse not my
power in the gospel.
19 For though I be free from all
yet have I made myself servant
unto all, that: might gain the more,
20 And unto the Jews I became
as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
to them that are uiidei I the law,
under the law, that I might gain
them that are and or the law;
21 To them that are without law,
as without law,(being not without
law to God, but under the law to
Christ,} that I might gain them tJhat
are without law.
22 Co the weBk became I in weak^

Judge in yourselves: is it

14 Doth not even nature Itself

15 But if a woman have long hair,

neither the churches of God.
17 Now in this that I declare unto

before other his own supper; and oae
is hungry, and another is drunken.
22 What l have ye not houses to

24 And when l)c had given thanks,
he brake and said Take, eat;
this is my body, which is broken
for you: this do in remembrance
of me,
25 After the same maimer also he
took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament
in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye
dri^k it, in remembrance of me.
26 For as often as ye eat this
bread, and drink t\in eup, ye do
sh&w the Lord’s deatK till he come.
27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat
this breads and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of
the body and blood of the Lord,
28 But let a man examine himself,
and so let him eat of that bread f and
drink of that cop,
29 For he that eateth and drink-
eth imworthily eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself not discerning
the Lord body,
30 For this cfiuae many are weak
and sickly among you, and many
sleep,
31 Far if we would, udge ourselves^
we should not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are
chastened of the Lord, that we should
not be condemned with the world.
33 Wherefore, my brethren, when
ye come together to eat, iarry one
for anotLer,
34 And if any man hunger, let
him eat at home, that ye come not

3 Wherefore I give you to under-

Spirit of God calleth Jesus aceursed:
and that no ruan can my that Jesus

4 Now thorn are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit,
5 And there are differsi:ces of
administrations, but the same Lord.
6 And there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God
which worketh all in all.
7 But the manifestation of the
Spirit is giveo to every man to
profit withal,
8 For to one is given by the Spirit
the word of wisdom; to another the
word of knowledge by the saoiespirit;
9 To auother faith by the game
Spirit; to another the gifts of heal log
by the same Spirit;
10 To another the worki tig of mi ra-

discerning ofspi rits^to auother divers
kinds of tongues; to another the
interpretation of tongues:
11 But all tht 使 worketh that one
and the sel^ame Spirit, dividing to
every man sevemlljr as he will.
12 For sls the body is one, and
hath many members, and all the
memLm of that one body, being
many, are one body: ao also is Christ.
13 For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Genliies, whether we he
bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit,
14 For the bud, is not one mem-

42 So also is the resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in corruption,
it is raised is incorraption:
43 11 is sown in dishonour, it is
raised in glory; it h sown in weak-
ness, It is rai&cfl in power:
44 It is gown a mthiral body it is
raised a spiritual body. There is a
natural body, and there is a spiritual
body,
45 And so it is written, The first
man Adam was made a living soul;
the last Adam was math a quickening
spirit.
46 Howhiet ihat turn not first
which Sh ^phutufil, but that which is

48 AS h the earthy, such are they
also that are earthy: and as is the
heavenly, snch are they also that are
heavenly.
40 And as we have borne the
imnge of the earth we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.
50 Now this I ssy, breth ren, that

again to you in heaviness,
2 For if I make you sorry who is
he then that maketh me glad but
the same which is made sorry by
me,
3 And I wrote this same unto you,
lest, when I came, I si 酬 Id have sor-
row from thesii of whom I ought to
rejoice, confidence In you all,
that my joy is (he joy of you ath
4 For out of much affliction and
anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears; not that ye should
be grieved, but that ye might know
the love which I have more abim-

5 But if any have caused griefj, he
hath not grieved me, but in part;
that I uiay not overcharge you all
6 Sufficient to such a man is this
pimUhmeat, which was inflicted of
many.
7 So that contrariwise ye ought
rather to forgive him, and comfort
him, lest porhaps ^ueh a one should
be swallowed up with overmuch
eorraw,

ye wcmlil confirm your love toward
him. 、

that I might know the proof of you,

CHAPTER IV,
rpHEEEFOTlE, seeing we lmve
丄 this ministry a3 we have
received mercy, we faint not;
2 But have renounced the hidden
things of dishonest 7, not walking in
craftiness, nor handling the word of
God deceitfully, but, by manifesta-
tion of the truth, commending our-
selves to every manb conscience in
the sight of God,
3 But if our gospel be hid, it is
hid to them that are lost:
4 In whom the god of this world
hath blinded the minds of
which believe not, lest the light of
the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
the image of God, should shine unto
them.
5 For we preach not ourselves,
but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
ourseiTes your servants for Jesus’
sake,
6 For God, who oomnmnded the
light to shine out of darkness hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ,
7 But we have this treasure is
earthen vessels, that the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not
of us.
8 We are troubled on every side,
jet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not is despair 5
9 Persecuted, but not forsaken;
cast down, but not destroyed;
10 Always bearing about in the
body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
that the life also of Jesus might be
made manliest iti our body.
11 For we v^hich live are alw&y
delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake,
that the life also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our mortal flesh.
12 So then death worketh in
but life in you.

6 Therefore we are always con-
fident, knowing that, whilst are
at hoim in the hoiy, we are absent

9 Wherefore we labour, that, i
whether present or absent, we may

10 For we must all appear before

every one may receive the things
done in his body, according to that he
hath whether it he good or bad -

OREOVEE, brethren, we do
you to wit of the grace of
God bestowed on the churches of
Macedonia ^
2 How that in a great trial of
affliction, the abundance of their joy
and their deep poverty abounded
unto the riebes of their liberality.
3 For to their power, I bear record,
yea, and beyond their power they were
willing of themselves;
4 Praying us with much entreaty
that %ve would receive the gift; and
take upon us the fellowship of the
inimstering to the saints.
5 And this they did, not as we hoped^
but first gave ibeir own selves to the
Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
6 Insomuch that we desired Titus,
that as he had begun, so he would
also finish in you the same grace also.
7 Therefore, as ye abound in every
thin 仏 in faith, and utterance, and
knowledge, and in all dilig6nce, and
in j^our love to us, 嫩 that ye abound
in this grace also.
8 I speak not by command men
but by occasion of the forwardness of
others and ta prove the eineerity of
your love.
9 For ye ktiow the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, though he
was rich, jet for your sakes he
became poor, that ye through 1)is
poverty might be rich.

10 And herein I give my advice:
for this is expedient for you, who
have begun before, nat only to do,
but also to be forward a year ago,
11 Now therefore perform the do-
Ing of it; that as there was a readiness
to willy, so there 7h<iy be a pe^formaii^e
also out of that which ye have.
12 For if there be first a ivilling
raind, it is accepted aceording to
that a man hath, and not according
to that he hath not,
13 3^or jf mean not that other men
be eased, and ye burdened:
14 But by an equality, that now
at this time your abundance may be
 supjyly for their wand that their
abuiulance also ma, be a supply for
your wand that there maybe equality:
15 AS it is written, fee that had
gathered much ]iad nothing over; and
he that hadgathered little bad nolack.
But tlmuks be to God, which
put the same earnest care into the
heart of Titus for you.
17 For indeed ise accepted the ex-
hortation, but being more forward,
of his own accord he went unto you,
18 And we hwe .sent with him
the brother, whose praise is is the
gospel throughout all the churches;
16 And not that oaly, but who
was also chosen of the churches to
travel with as with this grace, which
is administered by us to the glory of
the same Lord, and declaration of
your ready mind:
220 Avoiding this, that no man
shoiikl.Waxue us in this abundance
which !s administered by us:
21 Providing for honest things^
not only in the sight of the Lord,
but also in the sight of men.
22 And we have sent with them
our brother, whom we have often-
times proved diligent in many things,
but now much more diligeLit,;ipon
the great amMenee which I have
in you.

your mind, which I boast of you
to them of Macedonia that Acliaia
was ready a year ago; and your zeal
hath provoked very many.
3 Yet have I sent the brethren,
lest our boasting of you should be in
vain In this belialf; that, as I and,
ye may be ready:
4 Lest haply if they of Macedouia
come wit!) me, and find you
prepared, we (that we say not, ye)
Should be ashamed in this same con-
fident boasting.
5 Therefore I thought it necessary
to exhort the brethren, that they
would go before unto you, and make
up beforehand your botmty, whereof
jt bad notice before, thet the same
might be ready, as a matter o/"bounty,
and not as of covetousness.
6 But this Isay f He which soweth
eparingly shall reap also sparingly;
and he which soweth bountifully
shall reap also boiintifully,
7 Every man according as he pur-
poseth in his hearty so let him give;
not gnidgiggly, or of necessity: for
God loveth a cheerful giver.
8 And God is able to mnkeall grace
abound toward you; that ye, always
having all sufficiency in all things,
may aboond to every good work:

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE To THE
、 GALATIANS.
CHAPTER I.
an apostle, (not of men,
I neither by tmn, but by Jesus
Christ and God the Father who
raided him from the dead;)
2 And all the brethren which are
with me, unto the ctmrclies of
Galatia:
3 Grace to you and poaec, from
God the Father, and from our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4 Who gave himself for our Bins,
that he ral^lit deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the
will of God and our Father:
5 To whom be glory for ev^r and
ever. Amen-
6 I marvel that yo are So soon
removed from him that called you
into the grace of Christ unto another
gospel:
7 Which is not another; but
there be some theit trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ
8 But though we, or an angel from
heaven, preach any other gospel unto
you tlmu that which we have preached
unto you t let him be accursed,
9 AS we said before so say I now
again If any man preach any other
gospel onto you thau that ye have
received, let him be accursed
10 For do I now persuade men,
or God, or flo I seek to please men,
fo h if I yet pleased men, I should not
be the servant of Christ,
11 But I certify you, brethren,
that the} gospel which was preached
of me is not after main
12 For I neither received it of
mm, liei titer was I taugjit it t but bjr
the revtla^iOD of Jesus Christ.

13 For ye have heard of my ooa-
vernation In time past in the Jews’
religion; how that beyond measure I
persecuted the clmrch of God, and
wasted it:
14 And profited in tbeJe^V religion
above many my equals in mine own
nation, being more exceedingly Keal^
ous of the traditions of ray fathers.
15 But when it pleased God, who
separated me from my mother’s
womb, nu<J called me by his grace,
16 To reveal \in Son in me, that
I might preach him among the
heatlu,a; Immediately I conferred
not with flesh and blood:
17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem
to them which were a pasties before
me; but I went into Arabia and
returned again unto Damascua^
18 Then after three years I went
up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days.
19 But other of the apostles saw I
none, save James the LorcVS brother.
20 Now the things which I write
unto you, t^hold, beforeGod I He not. 〜 ^
21 Afterwards I came into the  ^
regioiis of Syria and Cilicia, 於默
22 And was tiuknown by face ^
unto the churdies of Judea which
were in Christ:
23 But they had heard only. That
he which persecuted us in times past
now preacheth the faith which once
he destroyed
24 And they glorified God in me.
CHAPTER II.
1 THEN fourteen years after I went
up again to Jerusalem with
Barriaha and took Til aswith me also,
2 And I went up by rove I at [on,

14 Bwt when I saw that they
walked not uprightly according to the
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter
before them all. If thou, being a Jew 7
livest afior the manner of Uentil&s,
and not as do they Jews, why compel-
lest thon the Gentiles to live as do
the Jews,
15 \Xg who are Jews by imtuie,
and not sinners of the Gentiles,
16 Knowing that fi man is not
justified by the work a of the I aw; but
by the faith of Jesus Christ even we
have believed in Jesus Christ, that
tvc might be justified by the faith of
Christ, and not by the works of the
law: jfbr by the works of the law
shall no flesh be justified,
17 But if, while we seek to be
justified by Christ we ourselves also
are found sinnera, is therefore Christ
the minister of sin, God forbid.
18 For if I build again the things
which I destroyed, I malce toysolf a
transgressor,
19 For I through the law am dead to
the ]aw, that I might live unto God,
20 I am crucified with Christ:
nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me: and the life
which I now live in the flesh I live
by the faith, of the Son of God, who
loved ine t and gave himself for me-
21 I do not frustrate the grace of
God t for if righteousness come by the
laW, then Christ is dead in vain.

5 He therefore that ministereth to
you the Spirit, and worketh miracles
among you, dodh he it by the works

6 Even as Abraham believed God^
and it was accounted to him for

7 Know ye therefore that they
which are of faith, the same are the
ohUdren of Abraham.
8 And the Scripture, foreseeing
that God would justify the heathen
through faith preached before the
gospel unto Abraham, saying, In
thee shall all nations be blessed.
9 St, then they which be of faith
are blessed with faithful Abraham,
10 For as nmuy as are of the
works of the law are under the curse i
for it is written, Cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things
which are written in the book of
the law to do them,
11 But that no mauis, ustifiqd by the
law in the sight of God, it is evident:
for, The just shall live by faith.
12 And the law is not of faith:
but The man that doeth them shall
live in them,
13 Christ hath redeemed us from
the curse of the law, being nmch a
oursc for us: for it is written, Cursed
如 every one that liaugeth on a tree:

18 For if the inheritaaee be oft be

God gave it to Abraham by promise.
19 Wherefore thin serveth the law,
It was added because of transgres-

whom the promise was made; and it
wcu ordaitied by angels in the lifmd
of a mediator.
20 Now a mediator is not a me-
diator of one, but God is One.
21 IS the law then against the
promises of God, God forbid: for if
there had been a law given which
could have given life, veril^righteon&-
neas should have been by the law,
23 But the Scripture hath con-
elnded all imcler sm, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be
given to them that believe.
23 But before faith came we wore
kept under the law, shut up unto
the faith which should afterwards be
revealed.
24 Wherefore the lawour

25 But after that faith is come,
we are no longer under a school-

20 I desire to be present with you

sCand in doubt of you,
21 Tell me, ye that desire to be

22 For it is written, the t Abraham
had two som, the one by a boruimaid,
the other by a free woman.
23 But he who was of the bond-
woman was bnrn after the flesh; but
he of the free woman was by promise^
24 Which things are an allegory:
for these are the two covenants; the
oae from the mmint Sinai, which
gendereth to bondage, which is Agar,
25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in
Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage
with her children.
26 But Jerusalem which is above
is free, which is ttve mother of us all.
27 For it is written Rejoice, thou
barren that beare&t not; break forth
and erv, thou that travaikst not: for
the desolate hath many more children
than sbe which hath a husband.
28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac
was, are the children of promise,
29 But as then he that born after
the flesh perBccuteti him that was born
after the Spirit, even so it is how.
NeTertheless what saith the
Scripture, Cast out the bond-
woQi&u and her son: for the son of
the bondwoman shall oot be heir
with the son of the free woman.
3lSo theo, brethven, we are notdiil-

CHAPTER V.
OTAND fi^st therefore in the
liberty wherevi ith Christ hath
made tis free and be not entangled
again with the yoke of bondage-
2 Behold, I Paul say unto you,
that if ye be: circuracised, Christ
shall profit you nothing,
3 For X testify again to every man
that is circumcised, that he is a debtor
to do the whole law.
4 Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are justified by
the law; ye are fallen from grace.
11 For we through the Spirit wait
for the hope of righteousness by faith,
6 For in Jesus Christ neither oir-
c lime him availeth any thing, nor mi-
circumcision; but faith which worketh
by love,
7 Ye did run wel“ who did hinder
you that ye should not obey the truth,
8 This persuasioa comdh not of
him that calleth jciu
9 A little leaven Ieavenetk the
whole lump.
10 I haveoonfidenoeiji you through
theLordjthatye will benoneotherwiso
mijided ibuthetliat troublet liyon shal 1
bear his judgment, whosoever he be,
11 And I, brethren, if I preach
circumcision, why do I yet suffer
persecution, then is the offence of
the erojss ceased.
12 I would they were even cut off
which trouble you.
13 For, brethren, ye have been
called unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the fleshy
but by love serve oue another.
14 For all the law h fulfilled in
one word, evm in this; Thou dm It
love thy neigh born I a.s thyself.
J5 But if ye bite and devour one
nnother, take lieed that ve be not
consumed one of another. ^

17 For the flesh, lu.steth agaipst

flesh: and these are contrary the
one to the other; so that ye cannot
do the things that ye would.
18 But if ye be led of the Spirit,
ye are not vmd or the law.
19 Now the works of the flesh are
manifest, which are these f Adultery^

Yariance, emulations 'wrath, strife,

also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not Inherit

22 liut the fruit of the Spirit is
loveJoy, peace, longsuffering gentle-
ness, goodness, iaith,
23 MeeJeness, tenspcraiie: against
such there is no law.
24 And they that are Christ’s
have crucified the flesh with the
affections and \mts,
25 If we live in the Spirit let na
also walk in the Spirit.
26 Let us not be desirons of vain-

spiritual, restore, such a one in the

self # lest thou also be tempted.
2 Bear ye one another’s hardens,

3 For if a man think himself to ba
something, whcti he k nothing, he
deceiveth hh-oself;

work, and thetf shall he have rejoicing
In himself alone, and not in another.

6 Let him that is taught in the
ward commtinicftte unto him that
teacheth in all good things,
7 Be not deceived; God is not
mocked i for whatsoever a man
saweth, that shall he also reap.
8 Yot he that soweth to his flesh
shall of the flesh reap corruption; but
he that soweth to the Spirit shall of
the Spirit reap life everlasting.
9 And let us not be weary in well
doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not,
10 AS we have therefore oppor-
tunity, let us do good unto all men f
especially unto them who are of the
household of faith.
11 Ye see how large a letter I
have written unto you with mine
own hand,
12 AS many as desire to make a
fair shew in the flesh, they constrain
you to be circumcised; only lest they
should suffer persecution for the crass
of Christ.
13 For neither they themseIves
who are circumcised keep the law;
but desire to have you eircuincised,
that they may glory in your fleshy
14 But God forbid that I should
glory  save id the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world in
crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.,
15 For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision availeth any thing, nor
tmcireumcision, but a new creature.
16 And as many as walk accord-
ing to this rule, peace be on them,
and merey, and upon the Israel of
God.
17 From lienoeforth let no man

edifying of the body of Christ:
13 Till we all come in the unity

the Son of Goc!, unto a perfect inan^
unto the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ:
14 That we henceforth be no more
children tossed to and fro, and carried
about with every ^ind of doctrine,
1^7 the elelght of men, and cunning
craftiness, whex I eby they he in wait

fitly joined together and compacted
by that which every joint sDpjjlieth,

27 Only let your conversation be
as it becometh the gospel of Christ:
that whether I come and see you, or
else be absent I may hear of your
affairs, that ye stand fast in one
spirit with one mind striving together
for the faith of the gospel;
28 And in nothing terrified by
your aflversaries: which is to them
&a evident token of p^rditkm, but
to you of salvation, and that of God.
29 For unto you it is given in the
behalf of Christ, not only to believe
on him but also to snifer for his sake,
30 Having the same conflict
which ye saw in and now hear
to be in me.

25 Yet I supposed it necessary to
sgdcI to you Epaphroditus, my broth-
er, and companion in ifthour, and
fellow soldier, bnt your messenger,
and he that ministered to my wants.
26 For he Longed after yo u al 1, and
was full of heaviness, because theit
ye had heard that he had boon sick,
27 For indeed he was side nigh
unto death: bufe God bad mercy on
him; and not on him only but on
me also, lest I should have sorrow
upon sorrem
28 I sent him therefore the more
carefully, thal when ye see him
again, ye may rejoice, and that I
may be the less sorrowful,
29 Receive him therefore in the
Lord with all gladne&s; and hold
soch in reputatHm:
30 Because for the work of Christ
he was nigh unto death, not regard-
ing his life, to supply your lack of
service toward me.

1 FINALLY, my brethren, rejoice
in the Lord, To write the
same things to you, to me indeed is
not grievous, but for you it is safe,
2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil
we risers, beware of the cmicision.
3 For we are the circumcision,
which worship God in the spirit,
and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have
no confidence in the flesh.
4 Though I might also have con-
fidence in the flesh. If any other
man thinketh that hc hath whereof

THESSALONIANS.
CHAPTER L
and Silvai 卿, and Timo-
丄 theiiSjUiito the church of theThes-
salonians which is in God the Father,
and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
he unto you, and peace, from God our
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 We give thanks to God always
for you all, making mention of you
in our prayers;
3 ilemembering without ceasing
your work of faith, and labour of
love, and patience of hope in our
lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of
God and our Father;
4 Knowing, brethren beloved,
your election of God.
5 For our gospel came not unto
you in word only, but also in power,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much
assurance; as ye know what maimerof
men we were among you for your sake.
6 And ye became followers of us,
and of the Lord, having received the
word in much affliction, with joy of
the Holy Ghost:
7 So that ye were ensaraples to all
that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
8 For from you sounded out the
word of the Lord not only in Mace-
donia and Aohaia, but also is every
place your faitla to God-ward is
spread abroad; so that we need not
to speak any thing.
9 For they themselves shew of us
what maimer of entering in we had
unto you, and how ye turned to God
from idols to serve the living and
true God;
10 And to wait for his Son from
heaven, whom he raised from the
dead, even Jesus, which delivered us
from the wrath to come.

CHAPTER II,
TpOE yourselves^
JD our eutranco i.
brethren, know
in unto you, that
it was not in vain:
2 But even after that we had suf-
fered before, and were shamefully
entreated, in ye know, at Philippi,
we were bold is our God to speak
unto you the gospel of God with
much contention.
3 For our exhortation ivcts not of
deceit, i tor ofnnclcanness nor inguile:
4 But as we、vere allowed of God
to be |iut in trust with the gospel,
even so w F e speak; not bs pleasing
men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
5 For neither at any time ased we
fiaticdug words, as ye Imow, nor a
cloak of covetousness; God  ivitm I 明:
6 Nor of men sought we glory^
neither of nor yet of others
when we might have been burdea-
some, as the apostles of Christ.
7 But we were gentle among you,
even as a nurse o!icriahe!h her
children:
8 So being affectionately desirous
of you we were willing to Iiavc
imparted unto you f not the gospel of
God only, but also our own semis,
because ye were clear unto us.
9 For ye remember, brethren; our
labour and travail: for labouring
night and tiay because we would not
be chargeable unto any of you, we
preached unto you the gospel of God.
10 Ye are witnesses』and God
ahoy bow holily and justly and
uublatneably wt! behaved ourselves
among you that believe:
AS ye know how we exhorted
and comforted and charged every one
of yo\\, as a father doth his childrfin,
12 That yo would walk worthy of
God, who hath called you unto his
kingdom and glory.

18 For this cause also thank we
God without ceasing because, when
ye received the word of God which
ye beard of us, ye received it not as
the word of men, kit; a3it is in truth,
the word of God, which effectually
worketh also in you that believe.
14 For ye brethren became fol-
lowers of the churches of God which
in Judea nrc, in Christ Jesus: for ye
also have suffered like things of your
own coun try a]^a, even as they have
of the Jews:
15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus,
and their own prophets, and have
persecuted us; and they please not
God f and are contrary to all men:
16 Forbidding us to speak to the
Gentiles that they might be saved;
to hll up their si us always: for the
wrath is come upon them to the
u tferrnofet.
17 But we, brethren; being taken
from you for a short lime in presence,
not in heart emlcavoiired the more
abundantly to see your face with
great desire,
18 Wherefore we would have come
unto you, even I Paul, once and
again; but Satan hindered us,
19 For what is our hope, or joj,
or crown of rejoicing, Are not even
ye in the presence of our Lotd Jtsua
Christ at his coming,
20 For ye are our glory and joy.
CHAPTER III
1 WHEREFOEE when we could
no longer forbear, we thought
it good to be left at At liens aloae;
2 And sent Timotheus our brother,

labourer in the gospel of Christ to
establish you, a tic! to comfort you
concerning your faith:
3 TImt no man should be moved by

should suffer tribulation; even as it
carae to pass, in\d ye know.
5 For this cause, when I could no

2 For ye know what command-

3 For thfa is the will of God, evm
your sanctification, that ye should
abstain from fornicatioa:
4 TImt every one of you should
know how to possess his vessel la
sanctification and honour;
5 Not in the lust of oonGupisceixcc,
even as the Gentiles which know
not God:
6 That no go beyond and
defraud his brother in any matter;
because that the Lord is the avenger
of «11 such, as we also have fore-
warned you and testified.
7 For God hath not called us unto
tincleanGss, but unto holines.^
8 He therefore that despiseth, de-
spiseth not man, but God, who hath
also given unto us his Holy Spirit:.
9 But in touching brotlverly love
ye need not that I write unto j^on;
for ye yourselves are tanght of God
to love one another,
10 And indeed ye do it toward all
the brethren which are in all Mace-
donia: but \yq beseech you, brethreji^
that ye increase more and more;
11 And that ye study to be quiet,
and to do your own business, and to
work with your own h&uds, &s we
com ra anded you;
12 That ye may walk honestly
toward them that are withoat and
that ye may have lack of nothing,
13 13ut I would not have you to be
ignoraat, brethren, concerning them
which, are asleep, that ye sorrow not f
even as others which have no hope,
14 For if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God
bring with him.
15 For this we say unto you by

3 For when they shall sny. Peace
and safety; then audden destruction
cometh upon them, as travail upon a
woraao with child, and they shall
not escape.
4 But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness that that day diould over-

5 Ye are all the children of light,
and the children of the day: we are
not of the night, nor of darkness
6 Therefore let in not slepp, as do
others; but let us watch and be sober.
7 For they that sleep sleep in the

we wake or sleep, wq should live to-

6 Now we command you, brethren,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye withdraw yourselves from
every brother that walketh dis-
orderly, and not after the tradition
which he received of tis,
7 For J yourselves know how ye
ought to follow us: for behaveti
not ourselves disorderly among you;
8 Neither did we eat any man^e
bread for nought; but wrought with
labour and travail night and day,
that we might not be chargeable to
imy of you:
9 Not because we have not pawer
but to make ourselves an ensample
unto you to follow us.
10 For even when we were with
you, this we oomrmuicled you, thafe
if any would not work, neither
should he eat.
11 For we hear that there are
some which walk among you dis-
csrderly 5 working not at all, but are
busy bodies.
12 Now them that are such we
comm and and ^xhort by our Lord
Jesus Christ, that with quietness they
work, and eat their own bread,
13 But ye, brethren, be not weary
in well doing.
14 And if any man obey not our
word by QiLS epistle, note that man,
and 3mve no company with him that
he may be ashamed.
15 Yotcount him not as an eneray,
but admonish him as a brother^
16 Now the Lord of peace himself
give you peace nlways by all means,
The Lord be with you all,
17 The salutation of Paul with

in every epistk: so I write.

that he counted me faithful putting
me into the ministry;
13 Who was before a blasphemer^

I obtained mercy, because I did it

worthy of all acceptation, that Christ

2 For kings, and for all that are

quief and peaceable life in all godh-
ness and lionesty.
3 For this is good and acceptable
in the eight of God our Saviour;
4 Who will have all men to be
^aved, and to come unto the know-
ledge of the truth.
5 For there u one God, and one
mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus;
6 Who gave himself a ransom for
all, to be testsified in due time.
7 Whereunto I am ordained a
preacher, oiul an apoetk, (I speak
the truth in Christ, and he not,）a
teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
yerity.
8 I will therefore that men pray
every where, lifting up holy lmnd^
without wrath and doubting.
9 In like manner also, that women
adorn themselves In modest apparel
with shamefacedness and sobriety;
not with braided hair, or gold, or
pearls, or costly array;
10 But (which becometh women
professing godliness) with good works.
11 Let the woman learn in silence
with all subjection.
12 But I suffer not a woman to
teach, nor to usurp authority over
the man but to be in silence,
13 For Adam was first famed,
then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived,
but the woman being deceived was
in the transgression.
15 Notwithstanding aha shall be
saved hi child bearing, if they con-
tinue in faith and charity and hoh-
ness with sobriety.

16 And without controversy great
is the mystery of godliness: God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the
seen of angels, preached unto
the Gentiles believed on in the world,
received up into glory►
‘ CHAPTER IY-
OW the spirit spcaketh ex-
^l i pressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the
faith, giving beed to seducing spirits,
and doctrines of devils;
2 Speaking lies in Isjpocrisy;
having their conscience scared with
a liot iron;
3 Forbidding to marry, and com-
manding to abstain from meat^, which
God hath created to be received with
thanksgiving of them which believe
and know the truth.
4 For every creature of God is
gtx>d, and nothing to be refused, if
if; be received with thanksgiving:
5 For it is sanctified by the word
of God and prayer.
6 If thou put the brethren in
remembrance of these things, thou
shalt be a good minister of Jesus
Christ, nourished up in the words of
faith and of good doctrine, where-
unto thou hast attained,
7 But refuse profane and old
wives I fables, and exercise thyself
rather unto godliness
8 For bodily exercise profiteth
httle; but godliness is profitable
onto all things liuving promise of the
hie that now is, and of that which Ig
to come.
9 This a faithful saying, and
worthy or all acceptation.
10 For therefore we both labour
and suffer reproad because we trust
in the living God, whois the Snviour
of all men specially of those that
believe.

10 Therefore I endure all things
for the elect's sake, that they may
also obtain the salvation which is in
Christ Jesus with eternal glory,
11 It is a faitljfol saying: For if

will deny us:

3 Without natural affection, truce-
breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce despisers of those that are
good,
4 Traitors, heady, in^bmiaded,
lovers of pleasures more than lovers
of God; ■
5 Having a form of godliness, but
denying the power Oiereof: from
such turn away.
6 For of this sort are they which
creep into hauses, and lead captive
silly women laden with sins, led
away with divers lusts,
7 Ever learning, and never able
to come to the knowledge of the
truth.

God, that cannot he, promised before
the world began;
3 But hath in dne times mjiDi-

Saviour;
4 To Titus, mine own son after the
common faith: Grace, mercy, and
peace, from God the Father and the
Jjotd Jesds Christ our Saviour.
5 For this cause left I thee in
Crete, that thou shouMest set in
order the things that are wanting,
and ordain elders in every clty,
I had appointed thee:
6 If an, be blameless, the luWbaiul
of one wife, having faithful children
not accused of riot or unruly,
7 For a bisliop must be blsimeless,
as the steward of God; not self-
willed, not soon angry, not given to
whiR, no striker, not given to filthy
lucre;
8 But a lover of hospitality, a
lover of good men, sober; just, holy,
temperate;
9 Holding fast the faithful word

10 For there are many unruly and
vain talkers and deceivers, specially
they of the circumcision:
11 Whoso months must be stopped,
who subvert whole houses, teaching
things which ihty ought not, for
filthy lucre’s sake.
12 One of them&elves, even a
prophet of their own, said, The
Cretiatis are alwaje liars, evil Leasts,
slow bellies.
13 This witness is trm Where-
fore rebuke them sharply that they
may be sound in the faith;
14 Not giving heed to Jesus
: fables, and commandments of then,
til at turn from the truth.
15 Unto the pure all things are
pure: but unto them that are defiled
and imb^lieving is nothing pure;
but even their mind and conscience
is defiled.
16 They profess that they know
God; but in works they deny him,
being abominable, and disobedient,
and unto every good work reprobote.
CHAPTER II.
3 UT speak thou the thenga which
)becooie sound doctrine:
2 That the aged men be sober^
grave, temperate sound in in
charity, in patience.
3 The aged women likewise, that
they be in belsaviotir as becometh
holiness not false accusers not
given to much wine, teachers of
good things i
4 Thiit thou may trach the young
women to be sober, to love tiseir
luisbands, to love their children,
5 To be discreet, chaste keepers at
home, good, obedient to their own
hushantls, that the word of God be
not blasphemed.
6 Young men likewise exhort to
be sober minded.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE To THE
HEBREWS.
CHAPTER I,
OD, who at sundry times and in
divers manners spake in time 遥
irs by the prophets.:
past unto the fathers by the prop
2 Hath !a these hst days spoken
unto us by his Son, whom he hath
appointed heir of all things, by whom
also he made the worltls;
3 Who being the brightness of his
glory, and the express iraage of his
jjerson and upholding all things by
the word of hb power, when he had
by himself purged our sins, sat down
Qu the right hand of the Majesty on
Wgh;
4 Being made so much better than
the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than
they.
5 For unto which of the angels
said he at any time, Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee,
And again; I will be to him a Father^
and he shall be to Die a Son,
6 And again, when he bringeth
in the firsbegotten into the world,
he saith, And let all the angels of
God worship him,
7 And of the angels he saith, Who
maketh his angels spirits, and his
ministers a flame of fire-
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy
throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a
sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre
of thy kingdom.
9 Thou hast loved righteousness,
and hated iniquity; therefore God,
even the God, Iijvth anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows,

Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
them that heard him;

with divei s miracles, and gifts of the

CHAPTER III.
1 THEREFORE holy brethren,
W partakers of the heavenly
calling, consider the Apostle and
High Priest of our profession, Christ
Jesus;
2 Who was faithful to him that
appointed him, as also Moses was
faithful in all his house.
3 For this man was counted
worthy of more glory than Moses,
Inasmuch as he who hath builded
the house hath more honour than
the house,
4 For every house is builded by
some man; but he that built all
things is God,
5 And Moses verily wa 线 ikithful
in all his house as a servand for a
testimony of those things which were
to be spoken after;
6 But Christ as a son over his
own house; whose house ^re we, if
we hold fast the confidence and the
rejoicing of the hope firm unto the
end,
7 Wherefore as the Holy Ghost
saith, To day if ye will hear his
voice,
8 Harden not your hearts, as in
the provocation, in the day of temp-
tation in the wikkrne&:
9 When your fathers tem])ted me,
proved me,&nd saw my works forty
years,
10 'V herefore I was grieved with
that generation and said, They do
always err in their heart; and they
have not known my wayg.
11 Bo I svrare jii my wrath, They
nlinil not enter into my rest.
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there
be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the liv-
ing God.

from among men is ordained
for men in things pertaining to God,
that he may offer both gifts and

2 l\i whom also Abraham gave
a tenth part of all; first being by
laterpretation King of ngbteou^
nea% and after that; also King of
Salem, which by King of peace;
3 Without father, without mother,
without descent, having neither be-
ginning of days, nor end of life; bnt
made like unto the Son of God;
abideth a priest continually,
4 Now consider how great this
man was, unto whom even the
patriarch Abraham gave the tenth
of the spoils,
5 And verily they that are of the
son§ of Levi, who receive the office
of the priesthood, have a ccramand-
ment to take tithes of the people
according to the law, that is of
their brethren, though they come
out of the loins of Abraham:
6 But be whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes
of Abraham, and blessed him that
had the promises,
7 And withoLit all contradiction
the less is blessed of the better,
8 And here men that rlio receive
tithes; but there iie receimth them, of
wbocn it is witnessed that he liveth,
9 And bs I may so my, Levi also,
who reociveth tithes, paid tithes in
Abraham.
10 For he was yet in the loins of his
father, when Melcliisedcc met him.
11 If therefore perfection were by
the Levitical pmsthood, (for under
it the people received the law,) what
fiitther need there that another
priest should rise after the order of
Melciiisedec, and not be called after |
thes order of Aaron,
12 For the priesthood being
changed f there is made of necessity
a change also of the law,
13 For be of whom these theDgs
are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe, of which no man gave att<,nd-

14 For it is evident that oar Lord
sprang out of Juda; of which tribe
Moses spake nothing concerning
priesthood.
16 And it is yet far more evident:
for that after the similitude of Mel-
cbisetlec there arbeth another priesti,
If! Who is ma<le, not after the
law of a carnal commandment, Imt
after the power of an eudkss life.
17 Por he Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.
15 For there is verily a disannul-
ling of the commandment going be-
fore for the weakness and itnprofit-
ableness thereof,
19 For the law made nothing
perfect but the bringing in of a
better hope did; by the which we
draw nigh unto God.
20 And inasmuch as not without
an oath he was made priest ..
21 (For those priests were made
without an oath; but this with an
oath by him that said unto him^
The Lord sware and will not repcot,
Thou art a priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedec:)
22 By so much was Jesus made
a surety of a tetter testament.
23 And they truly were many
]>riesf s, because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death:
24 But this man, bocauge he con-
timieth ever, hath an unchangeable
priesthood.
25 Wherefore be is able also to
save them to the uttermost that
come unto God by him, seeing he
ever livetn to make itUerce.ssion for
them.

27 Who needeth not daily, as
those high priests, to offer up sacri-
fice, first for his own sins, and then
for the people%: for this he did
oncC, when he offered up himself.
28 For the law maketh men high
priests which have infirmity; but

since the law, maketh the Son, who
is consecrated for evermore,

_i_N have spoken this in the sum:
We have such a high priest, who is
set on the right hand of the throne
of the Majesty in the heavens;
2 A minister of the sanctuary,
and of the true tabernacle, which
the Lord pitched, and not man.
3 For every high priest is or-
dained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore it is of necessity that this
man have somewhat also to
4 For H he were on earth, he
should not be a priest, seeing that
ther are priests that cjffer gifts
according to the law:
5 Who serve unto the exnmple
and shadow of heavenly things, as
Moses was admonblied of God when
he was about to make the taber-
nacle: for, See, paith he, that thou
make all things according to the
pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
6 But now hath he obtained a
more excellent ministry, by how
mnnh also is the mediator of a
better ooyeuand which was estab-
lished upon bettor promises,
7 For if that first G6venant had
been faultless, then should no place
have been sought for the second.

cularly.
6 Now when these things were
thus ordained, the priests went
always into the first tabeni^le, ac-
complishing the service of God.
7 But into the second went the
high priest alone once every year,
not without blood, which be offered
for himself and for the errors of
the people:
8 The Holy Ghost this signifying,
that the way into the holiest of all
was not yet made jmnifest, while
as the first tabernacle was yet
standing:
9 Whioh tf,«s a figure for the time
theti present, in which were offered
both gifts and sacrifices, that could
not make him that did the service
perfect, as pertaining to the con-

10 Winch stood only in meats and
drinks, and divers washiQgs, and

not made with Immls, tisat is to say,
not of thfs building;

15 And for this cause he is the
mediator of the new testament, that
by meana of death, for the redemp-
tion of the transgreasions that were
under the first tetament, they which
are called might receive the promise
of elernal inberitauce.
16 For where a testament is,
ttere mu&t also of necessity be the
death of the testator.
17 For a testament is of force
after men are dead: otherwise it
is ol no strength at all while the
testator liveth-
18 Whereupon neither the first
te&tament was dedicated without
blood.
19 For whom Moses had spoken
every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the
blood of Calves and of goat with
water y and scar let %vool, and liysaop,
and sprinkled both the book and all
the poople,
20 Sayings Thiis is the blood of
the testameDt which God hath
enjoined unto you.
21 Moreover he sprinkled like-
wise with blood both the tabernacle,
and all the v&ssels of the ministry,
22 And almost all things are by
the law purged with blood; and
wit! I out shedding of’ blood is no
remission.
23 It was therefore necessary that
the patte riis of things in the heavens
should be purified with these; but
the heavenly things themselves with
better sacrifices than these.
24 For Christ is not entered into
the holy pla 卿 made with ]umds,
which are the figures of the tme;
hut inLo heaven itself, now to appear
in the presence of God for us:
25 Nor yet that he should offer
himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every
year with blood of others;

10 By the which will we are
sanctified through the offering of the
body of 3as us Christ once/or all
11 And every priest standeth
daily ministering and offering often-

never take away sins:
12 But this man, after he had
offered one sacrifice for sins for

God;
13 From henceforth expecting till
his enemies be made 3ii& iootstool,

perfected for ever them that are

HEBREWS, XI-
6 But without faith it is impos-
sible to please him; for he that
cometh to God must Relieve that
he is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligeiitly seek him.
7 By^faith JSoah, being warned
of Goed of things not seen as yet^
moved with fear, prepared an ark
to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and
became heir of the righteousness
Tvhitjh is by faith,
8 By faith Abraham, when he
was called to go out mto a place
which he should after receive for an
inheritance, obeyed; and he went
outy not knowing whiiljer he went.
9 By faith he sojourned in the
land of promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in tabernacles with
Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him
of the earae promise:
10 For he looked for a city which
hath f&undations, whuse ballder and
maker is God.
15 Through faith also Sara
herself received strength to conceive
seed, and was delivered of a child
when she in^s past age, because she
judged him faithful who had prom-
ised,
12 Therefore sprang there even
of one, and him as good as dead, so
many as the stars of the sky in
mu It i tude  and as the and ^hich
is by the soa shore imiamerabltL
13 These all died in faith, not
having received the proraises, but
leaving seen them afar of and were
persuaded of thevi, nod embraced
thein, and confessed that they were
strangers and pilgnras on the earth.
11 For they that say such things
declare plainly that they seek a
country.
15 And truly, if they had been
miiKlial of that country from whence
they came out, they might have had
opportunity to have returned.

17 Ijy faith Abraham, wh«Q he
was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
that had received the promises
offered up his only begotten son f
18 Of whom it was said, That in
Isaac shall the seed be called:
19 Accounti tig that God was fthle
to raise him up, even from the dead;
from wheney also he received him

20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob
and Esau concerning things to come,
21 By faith Jacob, when he was
a dying, blessed hoih the sons of
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning
upon the top of his staff
22 By faith Joseph, when he
dle6, mack raeotion of the depart-
ing of the children of Israel; and
gave commandment conccruing his
bones,
23 By faith Moses, when he was
born, was hid three months of his
parents, because they eaw he was a
proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king’s commandment,
24 By faith Mose^, when he wm
come to yGaus, refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh daughter;
25 Choosing rather to suffer af-
fliction with the people of God, than
lo enjoy the pleasures of mn for a
season;
26 Esteeming the reproach of
Christ greater riches than the treas-
ures in Egypt: for he had respect
unto the recompense of the reward.
27 By faith he forsook Egypt,
not fearing the wrath of the king:
for he endured, «s seeing him who

36 And others had trial of erud

slain with the sword: they wandered

shame, and is set down at the right
hand of the throne of God.
3 For consider him that endured
such contratliction of sinners against
himself, lest be wearied and faint

14 But every man is tempted,
when he is drawn away of his own
lust, and enticed,
15 Then when Inst hath con-
ceived  it l>ri ngeth forth sin; and
sin, when it is ^nisliec! bringeth

16 Do not err 】in, beloved breth-

17 Every good gift and every
perfect gift is frojn above, and cometh
Sown from the Father of lights, with
which is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning,
18 Of his own will begat he us
with the woid of truth, that we
ahoukl be a kind of firstfniita of his
creatures,
19 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, let every man be swift to hear,
slow to speak, slow in wrath:
20 For the wrath of man worketh
not the righteousness of God,
21 Wherefore 1% apart all filth-
iness and superfluity of naiightiness,
and receive with .meekness the en-
grafted word, which is able to save
your sonfe,
22 But be ye dofirs of the word,
and not bearers only, demving your
own selves.
23 For if any be a hearer of the
word, and not a doe he is like unto
a man beholdiing his iiatuml face in

24 For he beholdeth himself and
goeth his wa^, and straightway for-
getteth what manner of miin he was.
25 But whoso looketh into the

which are now reported unto you by
them that have preached the gospel
unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
down from heaven; which things
the angels desire to look into.
13 Wherefore gird up the loins
of your jiHud, Ibe sober, and hope to
the end for the grace that is to be
brought unto you at the revelation
of Jesus Christ;
14 AS obedient children not
fjtsliioning yourselves according to
the former lusts in your ignorance:
15 But aw he which hath called
you is holy, so be ye holy in all
manner of conversation;
16 Because it is written. Be ye
holy; for I am holy.
17 And ) e call on the Father,
Avho without respect of persons
judge them according to every man^s
work, pass the time of your sojourn-
ing here in fear:
18 Forasmuch fts ye know that ye
tv ere not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold f from your
vaiu converfjation revived by tradi-
tion from your fathers;
19 But with the precious blood of
Christ, as ofn lamb without blemish
and without spot:
20 Who verily was foreordained
before the foundation of the worl(3,

3 For the time past of our life
may suffice us to have wrought the

4 Wherein they think it strange
that ye run not with them to the

6 For, for iliis cause was the gospel
preached also to them that are clead,
that they might be judged according
to men in the flesh, but live accord-

7 But the end of all things is at
hand: be ye therefore sober, and
watch unto prayer.
8 And above all things have

THE SECOND EPISTLE GENERAL OF
PETER,
CHAPTER I.
SIMON Peter, a servant and an
o apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
that have obtained like precious faith
with;is through the righteousness
of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
2 Grace and peace be multiplied
unto you through the knowledge of
God, and of Jesus our Lord,
3 According as his divine power
hath given unto in all things that
pertain unto life and godliness^
through the knowledge of him that
hath called in to glory and virtue:
4 Whereby are given unto us ex-
ceed i Eg great and ]irecions promises;
that by these ye might be par inkers
of the divine nature, having escaped
the corruption that is in the world
through lust.
5 An be&ides this, giving all
diligence, add to your faith virtue;
and to virtue, knowledge;
6 And to knowledge, temperance;
and to temper a nee, patience; and
to patience, gorlluicss;
7 And to godliness, brotherly kind-
ness;Evnd to brodicrlykinthi e,s, charity.
8 For if these things be in you, and
abunnid, they make you that shall
neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 But he that lacketh these things
is blind, and cftnnot see afar off, and
hath forgotten that he was purged
fro eh IiIb old sins-
10 Wherefore the rather, breth-
ren, give diligence to make your
ctilling and election sure: for if ye
do these things, ye shall never fall:
11 For so an entrance shall be
ministered unto you abundantly into
the everlasting kingdom of our Lord

12 WIIorefore I will not be negln
gent to put you always is remem-
brauce of these things, though ye
know (hem t and be established in

13 Yea, I think it meet, as long
am in this tabernacle, to stir you
up by putting you in roraembrance.
14 Knowing that shortly I must put
off this my tabernacle even as our
Lord Jesus Christ hath ^liewed me.
15 Moreover I will endeavour that
ye may be ^hh afier my decease to have
these things alwa}'s in remembrance,
16 For we have not followed cun-
jiuigly devised fables when we made
known unto you the power and
coming of our Lord Jt ' 娜 Christ, but
were eyewitnesses of his majesty,
17 For he received from God the
Father honour and glory, Tvbea there
caixie such a voice to him from the
excellent glory. Tills is my beloved
Son, hi whom I fun well pleased.
18 And this voice which came
from heaven we liciird when we
were wich him in the Jaoly mount
19 We have also a more sure word
of prophecy; where unto ye do well
that ye take lieed, as unto a light
that shined i in a dark place, until
the day daw», and the day star arise
in your hearts:
20 Knowing this that uo
prophecy of the Scripture is of any
private interpretation
21 For the prophecy came not in
old time by the will of man: but
holy men of God spalce as they were
moved by the Holy Ghast.
CHAPTER II
1 BUT there were false prophets
also among the people, even as
there shall be false teachers among
you, who privily shall bring hi
damnable heresies, even denying the
Lord that bought them, and bring
upon themsel a'cs swift destruction.

they with feigned words make mer-
obandise of you: whose judgment
now of a long time lingereth not,
and their damnation slunibereth not.
4 For if God spared not the angels
that sirnied, but cast them down to
h«ll, and (Iclivered thein into chains

judgment;
5 And spared not the old worl 屯

ed vings while they feast with you;

beguiling unstable souls: a heart
they have exercised with covetous
practices; cursed children:
15 Which have forsaken the right

the way of Bnlaimi the son of Bosor,
who loved the wages of unrighteous-
ness;

iquity: the dumb speaking with

the prophet,
17 These are wells without water,
clouds that are carried with a tem-
pest;to whom the mlst of darkness
is reserved for ever.
18 If or when they speak great
swelling, 即油 of vanity, they allure
through the I cists of the flesh t
through much wantonness those that
were clean escaped frooi them who
live in error,
19 While they promise them
libertj, they themselves am the
Servants of corruption: for of whom
& man is overcome of the same is
he brought in bondage.
20 For if after they have escaped
the pollutions of the world through
the knowledge of the Lord and

' CHAPTER III
1 THIS second epistle) beloved, I
now write unto you, in both
which I stir up your pure minds by
way of remembrance;
2 That ye may be mindful of the
words which were spoken before by
the holy prophets; and of the com-
mandment of us the apostles of the
Lord and Saviour:
3 Knowing this first, that there
shall come in the last days scoffers,
walking after their own
4 And saying. Where is the pro-
mise of his coming, for since the
fathers fell asleep, all things con-
tinue as they were from the begin-
ning of the creation.
5 For this they willingly are
ignoreni of, that by the word of
God the heavens were of old, and
the earth standing out of the water
and in the water:
6 Whereby the world that then
was, being overflowed ^ith water,
peri si ied:
7 But the heavens and the earth,
which are now, by the same word
a re kept in store reserved unto fire
jiguinst the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.
8 But, beloved, be not Ignorant
of this oae thing, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years,
imd a thoiisnad years as one day,
9 The Lord is not b\&c\c concern-
i tig his ])roniige, as some men count
Blackness, but is longsuffering to
us™ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to
repent a nee.

So But ye have an unction from

21 I have not written unto jon

because ye kttow it) and that no he
is of the truth.
22 Who is a liar but he that
denieth that Jesus is the Christ,
He is antic]ilist, that denieth t]in
Father and the Son.
23 Whosoever denieth the Son,
the same hath not the Father: [buf]
he that aclknov:ledgeth the Son hath
the Father also,
24 Let that therefore abide in you;
which ye 3mve heard from the begin-
ning. If that which ye have heard
from the beginning shall remain in
70 u a ye also shall continue in the
Son, and in the Father, .
25 And this is the promise that he
hath promised in, e 恍打 eternal life.
26 These things have I written
unto you concerning them that
seduce you.
37 Bufe the anointing which ye
have received of him abideth in you^
and ye need not that any man teach
you: but as the same anointing
teacheth you of all things, and in
truth, and is no he, and even as it
hath taught you, ye shall abide In
him.
28 And now, little children abide
in him; that when he shall appear,
we may have confidence, and not be;
ashamed before him at his coming
29 Ifye know that he is righteous,
ye know that every one that doeth
righteousness is boro of him.
CHAPTER III

the Father had bestowed u^-
on us that we should be called the

that loveth not his brother.
11 For this is the message that
ye beard from the begiuning, that
we should love one another.
12 Not as Cain, who was of that
wicked one, and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him, Be-
cause his own works were evil, and
his brother’s righteous.

:, JOHN, III.
13 Marvel not, my brethren, if
the world hate you.
14 We know that we haw passed
from death unto life, because we
love the brethren. He that loveth
not his brother abideth in death.
15 Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer: and ye know that
no nanrclcror hath eternal life abid-
ing in him.
16 Hereby perceive we the love
of God t because he laid down his
life for as i and we ought to lay
down our lives for the brethren.
17 But whoso hath this worlds
good, and seeth his brother have
need, and Bhutteth up his bowels of
companion from him, bow dwelloth
the love of God in him,
18 My little children let us not
love in -wordy neither in tongue;
but in deed and in truth.
19 And hereby we know that
are of the trnth, and shall assure
our hearts befure him.
20 For if our litart comlemn «s,
God is greater tlmn our heart, and
knowcth all things.
21 Beloved, if our heart condemn
us not, theifi have we confidence
toward God.
22 And whatsoever we ask, we
receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things
that are pleasing in his sight.
23 And this is his commandment.
That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ, and love
one another, as he gave us com-
mand merit.
24 And he that keepeth his ooni-
mandments dwelleth in him, and he
in him. And hereby we know thal
he abideth in by the Spirit
which he hath givtiu in.

CHAPTER IV.
1 BELOVED, believe not every
spirit, but try the spirits
whether they are of God: because
many false prophets are gone out
into the .world.
2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of
God: Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ h come in the
flesh is of God:
3 And every spirit that confesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh is not of God t and this is that
spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have
l^are thaf: it should come; and
even now already is It in the world.
4 Ye are of God, little children^
and have overcome them: because
greater is he that is is you, than he
that is In the world.
5 They are of the world: there-
fore speak they of the world, and
the world heareth them.
6 We ace of God: he that know-
etp God heareth mb; be that is not
of (iod heareth not us. Hereby
know we the spirit of truth, and
the spirit of error,
7 JBeloved, let us love one an-
other: for love is of God i and
every ono that ]oveth is born of
God, and knoweth God.
8 He that loveth not Icnmveth
not God; for God is love.
9 In this was manifested the love
of God toward us, because that God
eetit his only begotten Son into the
world, that we might live through
him.
10 Herein is lave, not that we
loved God, but that be loved ivs,
8iK] ^erxt his Son to bt the propitia-
tion for our sing.
11 Beloved, if God so loved us,
we ought also to love one another.

I JOHN, V
12 No man hath seen God at any
time. If we love one another, God
dwelleth in as, and his love is per-
fected in us ‘
13 Hereby know we that we
dwell in him, and iie in us because
he hath given us of his Spirit
14 And we have seen and <in
testify that the Father sent the Son
to be the Saviour of the world,
15 Whosoever shall confess that
Jesus is the Son of God, God
dwelleth In him, and he in God,
16 And we have known and be-
lieved the love that God hath to us.
God is love; and he that dwelleth
in love dwell 破 h !u God, and God
in him,
17 Herein is our love made per-
fect, that we may have boldness hi
the day of judgment: because as
he ifl, so are we hi this world.
18 There is no fear is love; but
perfect love casteth out fear: be-
cause fear hath torment. He that
feareth is not made perfect in love-
19 We love him, because he first
loved us,
20 If a man say I love God, and
hateth his brother, he is a liar: for
he that loveth not his brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath nut seen,
21 And this commandment have
we from him. That he who loveth
God love his brother also.
CHAPTER V.

I. JOHN, V. ■
章五 _酱一 第鹼約
2 By this we know that we love
the children of God, when we love
God, and keep his commandments.
3 For this is the love of God,
that we keep his commandments:
and his commandments are not
grievous.
4 For whatsoever is born of God
overcometh the world: and this is
the victory that overcometh the
worlds our: faith.
5 Who is he that overcometh the
world, but he that believeth that
Jesus in the Son of God,
6 This is he that <sidio by water
and blood, eyeit Jesus Christ; not
by water only, but by water and
blood. And it is the Spirit that
beareth witness because the Spirit
is truth.
7 For there are three that bear
record in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost and
these three are one,
8 And there are three that bear
witness in earth, the spirit and the
water, and the blood: and these
three agree in one.
9 If we receive the witness of
men, the witness of God is greater:
for this is the witness of God which
he hath testified of his Son.
10 He that believeth on the Son
of God hath the witness in himself:
ye that believeth not God hath
made him a liar; because he be-
lieveth not the record that God
gave of his Son.
11 And this is the record, that
God hath given to us eternal life,
and this life is in his Son.
12 He that hath the Son hath
life; and he that hath not the Son
of God hath not life.

13 These things have I writteh
unto you that believe on the name
of the Sob of God; that ye may
know that ye have eternal life, and
that ye may believe on the name of
the Son of God.
14 And thla is the confidence
that we Fiave in him, that, if ask
ao, thing according to his will, he
heareth us t
15 And if we know that he hear
as, whatsoever we ask we know
that we have the petitions that we
desired of him.
16 If any man see his brother sin
a sin which is not unto d^ath, he shall
ask, and he shall give him life for
them that sla not unto death. There
is & gin unto death: I do not say
that he shall pray for it.
17 All unrighteousness js sin: and
there is a sia not unto death,
18 We know that whosoever is
born of God sinneth not; but he
that is begotten of God keepeth
himself and that wicked one touch-
eth him not.
19 AtkH we know that we are of
God, and the whole world lieth in
wickedness.
20 And we know that the Son of
God is come, and hath given us &a
understanding, that we may know
him that is true; and we are in him
that is true, even in his Son Jesus
Christ. This is the true God, and
eternal life,

r~l^iHE elder unto the elect lady
and her children whom I love
in the truth; and not I only, but
also all they that have known the
truth;
2 For the truths sake, which
dwelleth in us, and shall be with us
for ever.
3 Grace be with you, mercy, and
peace, from Gad the Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ!;, the Sqii
of the Father, la truth and love,
4 I rejoiced greatly that I found
of thy children walking is truth, as
we have received a tx) tuna and meat
from the Father.
5 And now i beseech thee, lady,
not as though I wrote a new eom-
oian^ment unto thee, hut that which
we had from the beginning, that
we love one another.
6 An<I this is love, that we walk
after his com w and men ts. This is
the commandment, That, as ye have
henrd from the bKgimiirjg ye should
walk in it,
7 For many deceivers are entered
into the world, who confess not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.
This is a deceiver and an antichrist,
8 Look to yourselves, that we
Jose not those things which we have
wrought, but that we receive a full
reward.

5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully!
whatsoever thou doest to the breth-

6 Which have boriie witness of
thy charity be&re the church:
whom if thou bring forward on their
journey after a godly sort, thou
shalt do well:
7 Because that: for his name’s sake
they went forth, taking nothing of

8 We therefore ought to receive

10 Wherefore, if I come, I will
remember his deeds which he doeth,
prating against us with tudici 哪
words: and not content therewith,
neither doth he himself receive the
brethren, and forbiddeth them that
would, and casteth them out of the
church.

is evil, but that which is good. He
that doeth good is of God: but he
that doeth evil hath not seen GotL
12 Demetrius hath good report of
all men, and of the truth Itself: yea,
and we also bear record; and ye
know that our record is true.
13 I had many things to write,
but I will not with ink and pen
write unto thee;

THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF
JUDE.
1 JUDE, the servant of Jesus Christ
and brother of James, to them
that are sanctified God the
Father, and preserved in Jesus
Christ, and called:
2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and
love, be multiplied.
3 Beloved, when I gave &11 dilu
gence to write unto you of the
common salvation, it was need fill
for ine in write unto you and exhort
you that ye should earnestly contend
for the faith which was ouoe de-
livered trntQ the saints.
4 For there are.,.certain men crept
i a unawares who were before of
old ordained to this con deni nation,
ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into laaciyicHisness, and
denying only Lord awd
our Lord Jesus Christ.
5 I will therefore put you in
remembrance, though ye once knew
this, how that the J-roed, having
saved the people out of the land of
Egypt afterward de^troy^d them
that believed not.
6 And the angels which kept not
their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved is
everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of the great
day.

JUDE,
書大谮
7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah,
mnd the cities xibout thein in like
maimer, giving themselves over to
fornication, and going after strange
are s«t forth for an example,
suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire.
8 Likewise also thesefilthy dream-
ers defile the flesh, despise dominion,
and speak evil of dignities.
9 Yet Micbael the archangel^
when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of Moses,
durst not bring against him a rai 1-
jug accusation, but said The Lord
rebuke thee.
10 But these speak evil of those
things which they know not: but
what they know uatur&lly, as bruta
beasts, in those things they corrupt
themKelves,
11 Woe unto them 丨 for they have
gone in the way of Cain, and ran
greedily after the error of Balaam
for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying- nf Core.
12 These are gpote in your feasts
of charity, when they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fear:
clmitls they are without water carried
about of winds; trees whose fruit
witherelb, without fruit; twice dead,
plucked up by the roots |
13 Eagrng waves of the sea,
foaming out their own shame, wan-
dering stars, to whom is reserved
the blackness of darkness for ever,
14 And Enoch also, the seventh
from Adaro, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the I-rord cometIi
with teiA thousand of his saints,
15 To execute judgment upon all,
and to convince all that are imgodly
among them of all their ungodly
deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard
s^>eecbes which ungocliy sinners have
spoken against him.

brother, and companion in tribala-
tion, and in tlie kingdom and
patience of Jesus Christ, was in the
isle that is called Patmos, for the
word of God, and for the testimony
of Jesus Christ
10 X was in the Spirit on the
Lord’s day, and heard behind me a
great vokfi, as of a trumpet
11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega^
the first and the last: and, What
Thou seest, write in a book, and send
it unto the seven diarobes which are
in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto
Smyrna, and unto Ptrgftmos, and
unto Tbyflliray,and unto Sardis and
unto Philadelphia, and unto Lao-
dicea.
12 And I turned to see the voice
that spake with me. And being turn-
ed, I saw seven goiJen candlesticks;
13 And in the midst of the seven
candlesticks one like unto the Son
of man, clothed with a garment
down to the foot, and gift about the
paps with a golden girdle
14 His head and his hairs were
white like wool, in white as snow;
and eyes were as a Ha me of fire;
15 And his feet like unto fine
brasa as if they burned in a iiirtiace;
and his voice as the sound of many
waters,
16 And he had in his right hand
seven stars: and out of his mouth
went a sharp twoedged sword: and
his countenance was in the sun
sliineth in his strength.
17 And when I saw him I fell at
his feet as dead. And he laid his
right band upon me, saying unto
me, Fear not | I am the first and
the last:
18 JT am he that liveth, and wa.
deati; and, bdiold, I am alive for
evermore, Amm, and have the keys
of hell and of death.

and I know the blasphemy of theni
which say they are Jews, and are
noty but are the synagogue of Satan.
10 Fear none of those things which
thou shalt suffer: behold the devil
shall cast some of you into prison,
that ye may be tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days; be thou
faithful unto death, and I will give
thee a crown of life.
11 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall
not be hurt of the second death.
12 And to the angel of the church

saith he which hath the sharp sword
with two edges;
13 I know thy works, and where
thou dwellest, evm where Satan’s seat
is: and thou holdest fast my name^

2 And imraediately I %yns in the
Spirit: and, behold, a throne was set
in heaven and one sat oa the throne.
3 And he that sat was to look upon
like a jasper and a sardine stone: and
there was a rainbow round about the
throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
4 And round about the throuo
were four and twenty seats: and upon
the seats I saw four and twenty elders
sittings clothed in white raiment;
and they had on their heads crowds
of gou
5 And out of the throne proceeded
lightnings and thunderings and
voices; and there w^re seven lamps
of fire burning before the throne,
which are the seven Spirits of God.
6 And before the throne thet^e was
a sea of glass like unto crystal: and
in the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four beasts
full of eyes before and behind
7 And the first beast wa like a
lion, and the second beast like a calf,
«nd the third beast had a &ce as a
man, and the fourth beast was like a
flying eagle.

8 And the fo^r beasts had each of
them &ix wing.s about him; and, they
were full of eyes withui; and they
rest not dny and night, spying, Holy,
holy, holy Lord God Almighty,

9 And when those beasts give
glory and honour and thanks to him

hath prevailed to open the book, and
to loose the seven, seals thereof
6 And I be held, and, lo, In the

2 And he opened the boUomle^
pit; and there arose a smoke out of
the pit, as the einoke of a great

smoke of the pit.
3 And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the earth; and unto them
was given power, as the scorpions of
the earth have power.
4 And it was commanded them
that they should not hurt: the grass
of the earthy neither any green thing,
neither any tree; but ottly those men
which have not the seal of God in
their foreheacla.
5 And to them it was givea that
they should not kill them, but
that they should be tormented five
months: find their torment tvas aa
the torment of a ecorpLon > when he

6 And in those days shall men
seek death, and shall not find it; and

CHAPTER
1 ANDI saw another mighty angel
crome down from heaven,
clothed with a cloud: and a rain-
bow was upon his 3iead, and bia face
was as it were the sun, and his feet
bs pillars of fire:
2 And he had in his luuid a little
book open: and he set his right
foot upon the sea, and his left/ooi
on the earth,
3 And cried with a loud voice> as
rehm a lion roareth: and when he
bad cried s<iven thunders uttered
their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders
had uttered their voices, I was about
to write: and I heard a voice from
heaven saying unto me Seal up those
things which the eev I en thtra^ers
uttered; and write them not.
5 And the angel which I saw stand
upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven,
6 And sware by him that liveth
for ever and ever, who created iiea-
ren, and the things that therein are,
and the earth, and the things that
therein are, and the sea and the
things which are therein; that there
should be time no longer:
7 But in the (]a, . 2 3 4 5 6's of the voice of
the seventh angel, when he shall
begin to sound, the mystery of God

gave Inna his power, and his seat,

3 And I saw one of his heads as
it were wounded to death; and his
deadly wound was lien lt d: and all
the world wondered after the beast,
4 And they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast:
and they worshipped the beast, say-
ing, Who is like unto the beast, who
is able to make war with him,
5 And there was given unto him
a mouth speaking gmu things and
blashphemies; and power was given
unto him to continue forty and two
months.
6 And he opened his mouth in blas-
phemy against God, to blaspheme
his name, and his tabernacle, and
them that dwell in heaven.
7 And it was given unto him to
make war with the faints and to
overcome them: and power was given
Min over all kind rods, and tongues^
and nations.
8 And all that dwell upon the
earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the book of life of

9 If any man have an ear, let him

1 AND after these things I saw
another angel come down from
heaven, having great power; and
the earth was lightened with his
glory.
2 And he cried mightily with a
strong voice saying, Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is
become the habitation of devils and
the hold q{ every fowl spirit, and a
cage of every unclean and hateful
bird.
3 For all halions have drunk of
the wine of the wrath of her for-
nication and the kings of the earth
have committed fornication with her,
and the merchants of the earth are
waxed lich through the abimdance
of her delicacies,
4 And I heard another voice from
heaven, saying, Come out of her,
my people, that ye be not partakers
of her sins, and that ye receive not
of her plagues.
5 For her sins have reached unto
heaven, and God hath remembered
her shiqiitde^
6 Howard her even as she re-
warded you, and double unto her
Jotible according to her works: in
the cup which luith filled, fill to
her double.
7 How iiuidt she hath glorified
herself and lived deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow giv r e her:
for she saith in her heart, I sit a

21 And the remnant were slain
with the sword of him that sat upon
the horse, which sword proceeded
out of his mouth: and all the fowls
were filled with their flesh.
CHAPTER XX.
1 AND I saw an angel come down
from heaven, having the key
of the bottomless pit and a great
diain in his hand.
2 And he laid hold on the dragon,
that old serpent which is the Devil,
and Satan, and bound him a thou-
sand years,
3 And cast him into the bottom-
less pit; and shut him up, and set a
seal upon him, that he should deceive
the nations no more, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled; and after
that he must be loosed a little season.
4 And I saw thrones, and they
g&t upon them, and judgment was
given unto them: and I saw the
souls of them that were beheaded
for the witness of Jesus, and for the
word of God, and which had not
worshipped the beast, neither his
image, neither bad received his mark
upon their foreheads, or in their
Imnds; and they Lived and reigned
with Christ a thousand years.
5 But the rest of the dead lived not
again until the thousand years were
finished. This is the first resurrection,
6 Blessed and holy is he that hath
part in the first resurrection: on
such the second death hath no
power, but they shall be priests of
God and of Christ, and shall reign
with him a thousand years,
7 And when the thousand years
are expired, Satan shall be loosed
cut of his prison,
8 And shall go out to deceive
the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, God and
Magog, to gather them together to
battle: the number of whom is as
the sand of the sta.

9 And they went up on the
breadth of the earth, and compa^aed
the camp of the eamls about, and
the beloved city: and fire came
down from God out of heaven, and
devoured them.
10 And the that deceived
them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone, where the beast and
the false prophet are, and shall be
tormented day and night for ever
and ever,
11 And I saw a great white
throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven
fled away; and there was found no
place for them.
12 And I saw the dead, small
and great, stand before God; and
the books were opened: and another
book was opened, which is the booh
of life: and the dead were judged
out of those things which were
written in the books, according to
their works,
13 And the sea gave up the dead
which were in it; and death and
hell delivered up the dead which
were in them: and were
judged every man according to their
works,
14 And death and hell were cast
into the lake of fire. This is the
second death,
If) And whosoever was not found
written in the book of life was cast
Inio the lake of fire,

3 And I heard a great voice
out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men,
and he will dwell with them, and
they shall be his people, and God
himself be with them, and be
their God.
4 And God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes; and there
shall bt: no more deftth s neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain: for the
former things are passed away.
5 And he that upon the
throne said, Behold, I make all
things new. And he said unto me,
Write: for these words are true
faithful.
6 And he said unto me. It is
doiKS I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, I will give
ui.ito him that is athirst of the fouo-
tain of the water of life freely,
7 he that overcometh shall in-
herit all things; and I will be his
God, and he shall be my son. #
8 But the fearful, and un.be1Iev I -
ing, and the abominable, and mur-
derers, and whoremonger and
sorcerers, i \nd idolaters, and til
liars, shall have their part in the
lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone: which is tine second
death.
9 And there came unto me one
of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last
plagues, and talked with me, saying,
Come hitlser, I will shew thee the
bride, the Lamb’s wife,
10 And he carried me away in
the spirit to a great and high
mountain, and shewed me thjxt great
city, the holy Jerusalem, descending
out of heaven from God,
11 Having the glory of God: and
her light was like unto a stone most
precious, even like a jasper stone,

12 And had a wall great and
high, and had twelve gate, and at
the gates twelve angels, and names
written thereon, which are the names
of the twelve tribes of the children
of Israel:
13 On the east three gates; on
the north three gates; on the south
three gates; and on the west three
gates.
14 And the wall of the city had
twelve foundations and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb.
15 And he that talked with me
had a golden reed to measure the
city, and the gates thereof, and the
wall thereof,
16 And the city lieth foursquare^
and the length is as large as the
breadth: and he measured the city
with the twelve thousand
furlongs. The length and the
breadth and the height of it are
equal,
17 And he measured the wall
thereof a hundred and forty and
four cubits, according to the measure
of a man, that is, of the angel.
18 And the building or the wall
of it was of jasper: and the city was
pure gold, like unto clear glass.
19 And the foundations of the
wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones. The
first foundation jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a dial-
ceJour; tilt) fourth, an emerald;
20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixths
sardius; the seventh, chrysolite,
the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topas;
the tenth, a chrygopmsus; the ele-
venth, a jacinth; the twelfth, an
amethyst.
21 And the twelve gates were
twelve pearls; every several gate
of one pearl: and the street of
the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.

22 And I saw no temple therein;
for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it.
25 And the city had no need of
the sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in lit for the glory of God
did lighten it, and the lamb is the
light thereof.
24 And the nations of them which
are saved shall walk in the light
of it: and the kings of the earth
do bring their glory and honour
into it.
25 And the gates of it shall not
be shut at all by day: for there
shall be no night there,
26 And they shall bring the glory
and honour of the nations into it
27 And there shall in no wise
enter into It any thing that defileth,
neither whatsoever Avm'keth abomi-
nation, or maketh a lie: but they
which are written in the Lamb's
book of life.

CHAPTER XXII.
1 AND he shewed me a pure river
of water of life, clear as crys-
tal, proceeding out of the throne
of God and of the Lamb.
2 In the midst of the street of it,
and on either side of the river, wm
there the tree of life, which bare
twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
her fruit every month: and the
leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations.
3 And H>tre shall be no more
cur&e: but the throne of God and
of the Lamb shall be in it; and his
servants shall serve him i
4 And they shall see his face; and
\in name shall he is their foreheads.
5 And there shall be no night
there; and they need no candle^
neither light of the sun; for the Lord
God giveth them light: and they
shall reign for ever and ever.

6 And he said unto me, These sayings
are faithful and true: and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent
His angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be
done,
7 Behold, I come quickly: blessed
is he that keepeth the sayings of the
prophecy of this book.
8 And I John saw these things,
and I 1 card them. And when I had
heard and seen, I fell down to wor-
ship before the feet of the angel
which shewed me these things,
9 Then saith he unto me; See thou
do it not: for I am thy fellow servant,
and of thy brethren the prophets, and
of them which keep the sayings of
this book: worship God,
10 And he saith unto me, Seal not
the sayings of the prophecy of this
book: for the time is at hand
11 He that is unjust, let him be
unjust still: and he which is filthy,
let him be filthy still: and he that is
righteous, let him be righteous still:
and he that is holy, let him be holy
still
12 And, be hold; I come quickly;
and my reward is with me, tu give
every man according as his work
shall be.
13 I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, the first and
the last.
14 Blessed are they that do his
commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may
enter in through the gates into the
city.
15 For without are dogs and
sorcerer, and whoremongers; and
murderers, and idolaters and who
soever loveth and maketh a lie.
16 ¶ Jesus have sent mlna angel
to testify unto you these things in
the churches. I am the root and the
offspring of David and the bright
and morning star.
