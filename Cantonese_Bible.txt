IS ^ Now tlie birth of Jesus Christ
wus oti this wise : When as his moth¬

before they came together, she was
fount：] with child of the Hoty Ghost.
19 Then Joseph her busbaa3 ?
being a just man t aad not willmg
to make Iier a public exampk, waa
minded to put her away privily,
20 But wiille lie tlionglit on these
tili ngs ， behold^ the angel of the Lord
appeared unto Sum in a dream ，
sayings Joseph, thou son of David ?
fear uot to take unto thee Mary thy
wife i for that wliioli is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost,
21 And she sliaU bring forth a son,
and thou shalt call hia name JESUS:

being interpreted is } God with us.
24 Then Joseph being raised from

18.耶穌基督出世、列明在後佢母親馬利亞係已經許聘約瑟、但未會成婚、覺得佢受聖靈感動嚟懷孕。
19.佢個丈夫約瑟係公義嘅人、唔肯顯然羞辱佢、就想靜中退親。
20.正在想開呢的事個時、主嘅使者在夢中現顯過佢、話、大闢嘅後裔約瑟呀、唔怕娶你嘅妻馬嚟亞因爲佢所懷之孕、你從聖靈感動嘅、
21.佢將來生個仔、你就改佢名做耶穌、因佢要救佢百姓出罪惡中嘅。
22.但凡呢的事做成、就應嘵主託先知所講、話、
23.睇*、將來有個未嫁嘅女、懷孕生仔、人哋呌佢名做以馬內利、繙譯卽係神同埋我哋。
24.約瑟瞓醒起身、依住主嘅使者吩咐去做、就娶佢妻。
25.但唔共佢同房、致到佢生仔、就改佢名做耶穌。

"VTOW when Jesus wos bom in

days of Herod the king, bdioldj
there came wise men from the east
to Jeru?nkm,
2 SayiBgj Where is be tliat is
born King of the Jews? for we
have seen his stnr in the east, and
aie come to worship him.
3 When Herod the king had
heard these things } lie was trouble 屯
and all Jerosalem with liim.
4 And when he had gathered
all the chief priests and scribes
of tbe people together, tie demanded
of them 'vLici'e Christ sliould be born.
5 And they said unto him ； In
Betlilehem of Judea: for thus it is
written hy tbe prophet^
6 And thou Betlileljem> in tlie
land of Jtida ? art not the least
among; tlie princes of Juda: for
out of thee shall come a Governors
that shall rule my people Israel.
7 Then HerotJ^ when he Imd
privily called the wise men，inquired
of them diligently what time the
star appeared*
8 And lie sent tliem to Bethlehem,
end Go and search diligently for
tbe young cbild *, and wlicii ye have
fouEid him } bring rue word flgain ? tlmt
I may corae and worship him also*
9 When they had heard the king,
tliey departed; and, lo^ the star ，
which they saw io the east，went
before them，till it came and stood
over where the young child was,
10 Wlien they saw the star ，they
rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
11 J And when they were come
into th^ house^ they saw the young
child with Mary his mother 9 and fell
dowiij aod worshipped him; and wh^u
they had Opened their treusnre^
they presented onto him gifts j gold,
and frankincense, and myrrli.

1.當希律王個時、耶穌既喺猶太伯利恒出世、有幾位博土、喺東便嚟到耶路撒冷、
2.話、生出嚟做猶太人王嘅喺邊處呢因我哋喺東便、聲見佢粒星、故此嚟拜佢
3.希律王聽聞、就慌起嚟通耶路撒冷都係。
4.噉就呌齊衆祭司辰、同民間*書人嚟問、話基督應該喺邊處出世呢。
5.衆人對佢話喺猶太伯利恒因爲先知有寫落噉話、
6.猶太地伯利恒呀、你喺猶太府縣中、唔係至小嘅因爲將來有個君王喺你處出嚟保養我以色列百性嘅。
7.於是希律靜靜呌個的博士嚟、細問個粒星、你幾時現出。
8.就打發佢哋去伯利恒話你去落力査問個細佼仔、搵看、就話過我知、等我亦去拜佢。
9.博士聽見王所講、就起行去咯、忽然在東便所見個粒星喺前頭引佢哋、引到個細佼仔所住個處、就止在佢上頭。
10.博士睇見個粒星、歡*到了不得。
11.入到屋裏、見細交仔、同埋佢母親馬利亞、就跪倒拜個細佼仔打開佢嘅寶盒、*禮物獻上、卽係黃金乳香沒藥。

12 And being warned of God in
& dream that they should not retorn
to Herod 5 they departed into llieir
own country another way,
13 And wlien they were depart¬
ed, behold, the angd of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dr earn,
saying ， Axise ? and take tiie young
child and his mqtli^r ? and ilee into
Egypt，and be thou there imtil I
bring tliee word : for Herod will seek
the young child to destroy him.
14 When lie arose, lie took the
young child and his raotlier by niglit,
and departed into Egypt :
] 5 And was there until tlie death
of Herod : thut it niiglit be fulfilled
^wiiich was spok^ii of the Lord bj
the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt
have I calkd my sou,
16 If Then Herod, when he saw
that he weih rnoeked of tlie 'wifeti raen ，
was exceeding wroth, and sent forth,
ami skiw all the children that were
in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
thereof, from two years old and
under, according to the time which
he had diligently inquired of the
wise men,
17 Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saymg,
18 In Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation，and weepings
and great monrnlng ? Kacliel weeping
for her elsildren ? anti wmild not be
eorafortetl^ because they are not.
19 Bu t u r hen Ilei ocl was dead,
behold 7 an siagel of tlie Lord ap¬
peareth ia a dream to Joseph in
Egypt,
20 Saying, Arise，and take the
joang chiW and his mother ? a ad go
into the land of Israel : for they are
dead which sought the young child's
life,
21 Aud he arose, and took tbe
young child aud his mother, and
came into tlie land of Israel*

12.愽士喺夢中得默示、呌咪番去希律處、就喺別條路番歸本土。〇
13.佢哋去之後、主嘅使者、在夢中顯現過約瑟、話、起身、帶個細佼仔、同埋佢母親、走去埃及、喺個處等我指點你、因爲希律將要找尋個細他佼仔嚟殺佢。
14.約瑟卽時起身、帶個細仔、同佢母親、漏夜走去埃及。
15.喺個處、至到希律死曉瞰就應曉、主託先知所講、話、已經呌我子出埃及咯。
16.個陣希律既知到被博士欺*倒、就極惱使人將伯到、恒與及個處附近嘅地方、所有細佼仔、依住細問博士個時、但凡自兩歲以下嘅、盡哋殺*噉。
17.就應嘵 先知耶利米所講、話、
18.喺拉馬地方、聽聞呌喊深傷嘅聲、拉結氏喊佢仔、因冇得留存、所以唔受安慰。
19.希律死嘵、主嘅使者、喺埃及處、在夢中顯現過約瑟、
20.話、起身、帶個細佼仔、同佢母親、去以色列地方、因個的找尋細抆仔性命嘅、己經死咯佢就起身、帶
個細佼仔同佢母親、嚟到以色列地方。

22 But wlien he heard that Arclie-
laus did reign in Judea in the room
of Ins father Herod, he was nfraiti to
go thither : notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a dream, he turned
aside into the parte of Galilee i
23 And lie came and dwelt in a
city called Namreth : that it
be fiiliilled wliich was spoken by tlie
L>Iiets* He shall be called a

CHAPTER III,
J'N those dnjs came John tlie Bap-
-1- tistj preaching in the wilderness
of Judea,
2 And saying, He pent ye: * for
tlie kmgdom of heaven ia at hand,
3 For tins is lie that waa spoken
of by the propliet Esaias, saying,
The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the LiOrdj make his paths straight.
4 And the same John iiad liis
raiment of camels hair: and a leath¬
ern girdle about his loins; and his
meat was locusts and wild hotkey*
5 Then went out to him Jeru-
salem, and all Judea^ and all the
region round about Jordan ，
G And were baptiaed of him in
Jordan, confessing tlieir sins,
7 Hat when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Saddoeees come to his
baptism, he said unto them，0 gen¬
eration of vipers, who hatli warned
yon to from the wratli to come ?
8 Bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance :
9 And thank not to say within
yourselves, Wc have Abraham to
ovr father : for I say unto jqu } that
God h able of these stones to raise
up ciiildren unto Abraham.
10 And now also the axe is kid
unto ihe root of the trees : therefore
every tree wliieh bringeth not: forth
good fruit la hewn down, and cast
into the fire.

22.但係聞得亞基老喺猶太繼住父親做王、就怕去個處、惟係在夢中得默示、故此番去加利利境地。
23.到一個城、名呌拿撒勒、就喺處居住、撖就應曉衆先知所講、人哋將要呌佢做拿撤勒人咯。

第三章


1.當個陣時、施洗禮嘅約翰嚟到、喺猶太曠野傳道、話、
2.你哋當要悔改、因爲天國近咯。
3.呢個人就係先知以賽亞所講嘅、話、在曠野有人聲喓話、預備主大路整直佢小路。
4.呢個約翰、所*係駝毛、腰束皮帶、所食嘅係蝗蟲野蜜。
5.個陣時、耶路撒冷通猶太與及約但四方嘅人、都嚟親就佢、
6.衆人認自己罪、喺約但河受佢洗禮。
7.約翰睇見好多法唎賽人、同埋撒吐該人嚟受佢嘅洗禮、就對佢哋話、毒蛇之類呀、邊個敎你避後來嘅震怒呢。
8.所以當結果合於悔改。
9.你哋心中咪話、我哋有亞伯拉罕係祖宗呀、因爲我話你知、神能將呢的石做亞伯拉罕嘅子孫。
10.如今斧頭已經擠落樹脚、但凡樹木唔結好杲嘅、就斬嘵*落火處。

19.故此但凡毁壤呢的試命至微小嘅一條、又敎人噉樣做喺天國必定話佢係至微小、惟係但凡遵依試命嚟做、及敎人嘅、喺天國必定話佢係大咯。

31.又有話若係有人出個妻、就要寫分書俾過佢。
32.但係我對你話、但凡唔係因姦淫嘅緣故出佢妻、就係使佢行淫咯、人若娶個被出嘅婦人、亦係行淫咯。〇
33.你又聞得有對過古人話、你所發嘅誓、唔好違背、對主發誓嘅、必要依番嚟做。
34.但係我話、總唔好發誓、唔好指天嚟誓、因爲天係神嘅座位呀、

41.有人勉强你行一里路、你就共佢行二里路。
42.*你嘅就俾過佢、想共你借嘅咪榷辭佢。〇
43.你聞得有話要愛你嘅鄰舎懀你仇敵。
44.但係我對你話、共你做仇敵嘅要愛佢難爲你嘅要替佢祈祈幬。
45.*樣就可以做得你天父嘅仔咯因佢出熱頭嚟照善人及惡人、落雨喺義人及不義人處呀。
46.你若係愛個的愛你嘅、有乜賞賜私*税吏亦嗒(咯)係瞰樣做咩

10.或者求魚俾蛇過佢呢。
11.你哋雖係惡、尙且知到俾好嘢過仔女、可况你父在天、有唔；好嘢賜過求佢嘅咩。
12.所以你哋但凡想人撖樣待你、你是必要撖樣待人、因爲呢的係律法與及先知嘅恴思呀。〇
13.你應該入個度窄門、因爲引人
到沉淪處、個度門係闊、個條路係大、又入去個處嘅係多。
14.但係引人到生活處、個度門係窄、個條路係細、又榲得着嘅係多少。〇
15.你哋提防個的爲先知、佢嚟你處、外面裝或羊咩撖、裹頭實係殘惡職豺狼。
16.因佢嘅果子、就可以識得佢出哩、喺*棘摘得倒善提子咩、喺蔾蒺摘得倒無花果咩。

it fell : and great was the fall of it.
28 And it earae to pass, when

27.雨淋、水浸、風吹、接間屋、顴就跌曉、而且跌得好交關呀。
28.耶穌講完呢的說話個時、百性驚奇佢嘅敎訓。

31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are

32 Whosoever tlierefore shall
confess me before men, him will I
confess also before my Father which

33 But whosoever shell deny me
before men ? him will I also deny
before my Father which ia in

34 Tiiink not that I am come to
send peace on earth : I came not to
send peace, but a sword.

daughter against her mother, and the
daughter in law against her mother
in law.

CHAPTER XL
八 ND it came to wben Jesus
had made an end of com-
manding Iiis twelve disciple^ lie
departed thence to t^aeli and to
preach in their cities.
2 Now when John had heard in
the prison the works of Christ ? he
sent two of his disci pies»
3 And said unto him^ Art thou he
that should come^ or do we look for
anotlier ?
4 Jesus answered and said unto
t}iem ? Go and sliew John again those
things which ye do liear and see :
5 Tlio blind receive their sight ，
and the lame walk, the lepers are
cl caused ; and the deaf Iiear ? the dead
are raised up ? a ad the poor have tlie
gospel preached to them,
6 And blessed is he f wliosoevor
eliall not be offended ia me.
7 Tf Ami as they departed, Jesus
began io say unto the rnultitudes
concerning John, What went ye out
into the ^vilderness to see ? A reed
si ] a ken with the wind ?
8 But what went ye out for to
see? A man clothed hi soft raiment ?
beholdj they that wear soft clothing
are in Idngs’ houses*
9 But what went ye out for to 鄉？
A prophet ? yea, J Bay unto you, and
more than a propliet,
10 For this is hc f of whom it is
written ， Behold, I seiid my messenger
before thy iace, which shall prepare
thy way before tliee,
11 Verily I say uato you, Among
them that aro bom of women there
bath not risen a greater tlian John
the Baptist ： aotwitl:standiug^ lie that
is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he*
12 And from the days of John the

St. MATTHEW, XIII,
18 Hrar ye therefore the par¬
able of the aower,
19 W h en any one licareth the word
of tJiu kingdonij and imclerstandetb
it not, then cometh the wicked one,
a lid catch etli away that which was
sown in liis heart This is he whi-eli
received seed by tlie way side,
20 But he that received the seed
into stony places^ the same is lie that
hcaretb the word, and anon witlr joy
receiveth it \
21 Yet hath lie not root in
but doreth fora wlule: for when trih^
illation or perseculioia ariseth becavtae
of tlie wordj by atid he is offended,
22 He alst> that received seed
among the thorns is he that hoareth
the word \ and the mre of this world,
and the deoeitfuhaess of richer choke
the word，and liebecometliunfruitfuL
23 But he tlmt received seed Into
the good grotincl is lie tbat hearet.h
the wordj and understandeth it 9
which also beareth fruit, and bringetli
forth ? some a liaiidredfokl, some
sixtyj some thirty.
24 If Another parable put be fortli
mi to them, saying, i'hc kingdom of
heave a is likened unto a rmm which
sowed good seed in his fidd i
25 Bui while men sl^pt ? l]is
enemy came and sowed tares among
the wheats and went his way,
2G But when the blade was sprung
up, and brought forth fruit, tlmx
ap])eareci tlie tares also.
27 So the servants of the house¬
ll older came and said unto him, Sii 、
didst not thou sow good seed in tliy
field ? from whence then hath it tares?
28 He said unto enemy
hath done this* The servonte Faid
unto him. Wilt tliou then that wc go
and gather them up ?
29 Bu t he saidj Kay ； lest while ye
gather up the tareB ? ye root up also
the wheat with them.

T *f Woe unto the world because
of offences! for it must needs be
that offences come ; but woe to that
man by whom tlie offence oometli!
8 "Wherefore if thy hand or thy

cast them from thee : it is better for
thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
rather than having two bands or two
feet to be cast into everlasting 冇 re.
9 And If tlnne eye offend
pluck it out and cast it from thee:
it is better for thee to enter into life

ing no issue ； left his wife unto his

26 Likewise the second also, and

27 And last of all the woman

28 Therefore in the rosnrrectioiij
whoso wife shall she be of the seven ?
for they all had her.
29 Jesus answered and 说 dd unto

ScrjptuieSj nor the power of God.
30 For in tlie resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as tlie angels of

31 But as touclilng tlie resurrec¬
tion of the dead, liave ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by
God, my ing f
32 I am the God of Abralmm, and
the God i)t IjsaaCj and tlie God of
Jacob? God is not the God of the
dead, but of the llviog.

27 For as the liglitning oometli

28 For wheresoever the carcass is,
there will the eagles be gathered to¬

29 Tfl mmed iatelj after the tribula¬
tion of those days shall the sun be
darkened ^ and the moon shall not

30 And ilien shall appear the sign
of the Son of man in heaven ； and
then shall all the tribes of the earth
mourn ? ancl tliey shall see tlie Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven

8 Wherefore that field was called ?
The field of blood, onto this day.
9 Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet ?
saying, And they took the thirty
pieces of si H er ? the price of him that
wns valued, whom they of the chil¬
dren of Israel di<J valne;
10 And gave them for the potters
field, as the Lord appointed me,
11 And Jesus stood before the —o
governor : and the governor asked 3B-
him ， saying. Art tboo the King of the 置
Jews ? And Jesus said unto him,
Thoo sajest,
12 And when lie was accused of
the chief priests and eld«rs, he
answered nothing,
13 Thea said Pilate onto him ?
I CeareBt thou not how manj things
they witness against tliee?
14 Aod he answered hiin to never
a word ; tn^omuch that the governor
marvelled greatly.
15 Now at that feast the governor
was wont to release unto the people a
prisoner, whom they would,
16 And they had then a notable
prisoner, called Bar abbas.
17 Therefore when they were
gathered together, Pilate said unto
them, AYliom will ye tliat I release
unto you ? Bar abbas，or Jesus whlcii
is called Christ ?
18 For he knew that for envy they
had delivered him,
19 If Wlien he was set down qxx
the judgment seat，his wife sent unto
him, sayings Have tliou nothing to do
with that just mant for I have
suffered many things this day in 狂
dream because of him.
20 But the chief prifsts and elders
persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbag ; and destroyJesus.
21 Tbe governor answered aud
^aid unto them ， Whether of the
twain will ye that I release unto you ?
They said, Barabbas*

7 And preach ed ? saying } There
cometh one mightier than X after me,
the latdiet of whose shoes I am. not
worthy to stoop down and unloose.
8 I indeed have baptized you with

10 And let him that is in the field

his srarraent.
17 But woe to them that are with
childj and to them that give suck in
those days!
18 And pray je that your flight be
not in the winter.
19 For in -those days shall be ajfflic-
tion, such m was not from tlie begin¬
ning of the creation which God creat¬
ed unto this time, neither shall be.
20 And except that the Lord had
gliortened those days, no flesh shoald
be saved : hwt for the elect's sake ，

21 And then ifariy man shall say

23 But take ye heed : behold, I

24 If But in those days，after that
tribulatioiij the Sun shall be dark¬

25 And the stars of heaven shall
full, and the powers that are in
heaven shall be slmken.
20 And tlien shall they see ibe Son

27 And then shall he send his

name was Elisabeth,
6 And they were both riglitcoua
before God 3 walking in all the com-

Lord blameless,
7 Ami they had no child，becausa
that Elizabeth was barren w 7 and they

9 According to tlie custom of the

St, LUKE, I,
11 And there Appeared unto him
an angel of the Lora standing on the

12 And when Zacliaiias saw Mm:lie

Fear notj Zaelmrias : for thy prayer

ami the fowls of the air devoured it.
0 And some fell upon n rock; and bs

10 And he said，Unto you it ia given
to know the mysteries of the kingdom
of God; btit to otbers in panibles;
that seeing they might not see, and

11 Kow the parable is this: The
seed is the word of God.

S If Take heed to yourselves; If

rebuke him; and if lie repent) forgi ve
him,
4 And if he trespass against thee
seven times iix a day ; and seven

might &ay unto this ejeamme tree ，
Be thou plucked op by the roo^ and
be tliou planted in the sea ； and it
should obey you,
7 But which of you^ having a ser¬

12 And as he entered into a certain
village, tliere met him ten men tliat
were lepers, which stood afar off:
13 And they lifted up their voioeSj
and sEtulj Jesus^ Master，have racrcy
on us, j
14 And when he saw them } lie said
unto them，Go shew yourselves onto !
the priests^ And it came to pass’ that ，
as they went, they were cleansed. :
15 Aud one of thenij wlien he saw
that lie was healed, turned hack，and
mth a loud voice glorified God ， i
16 And fell down on Ms face at |
Ijis feet, giving him thanks : and bo
was a Samaritan.
17 And Jesus answering sald^ Were
there not ten cleansed ? but where
arc the nine?
18 There are not found that re¬
turned to give glory to Godj save this
stranger*
19 And he said unto him. Arise,
go thy way: thy faitli hath made
thea whole,
20 And when lie was demanded
of the rimriseeSj when the kingdom
of God should come ? he answered
tliem and said，The kingdom of God
cometh not with observation :
21 Is either shall they say } Lo here!
oi\ lo there! for, behold/ tlie king-
dom of God is within you.
22 And lie said unto the disciples ?
Tlie days will come, whm ye shall
desire to see one of the days of the
Son of mnn } and ye shall not see iL
23 And they shall say to yon ； See
here; or，see there : go not after
them, nor follow them,
24 For as the lightning, that light-

26 And as it was in the days of
Noe，so shall it be also in the days of
the Son of man,
27 They did cat, they drankj they
married \vives ? they were given in
maniagej until tlie day that Noe en¬
tered into the ark, and the flood
came，atid destroyed them all.
28 Likewise ako as it was in the
days of Lot; they did eat 5 they drank ，
they bought, they sold，they planted,
they builded;
29 But tlie same day that Lot went
out of Sodom it rained fire and brim-
stone from heaveiij and destroyed
them all,
SO Even thus shall it be in the day
when the Son of man is revealed.
31 In that dnj } he which shall be
upon the housetop, and Ins stuff in
the liouse^ let him not come down to
take it away : and he tliat is 玉 n the
field, let lilm likewise nat return back,
32 Ueniember Lot’s wife.
33 Whosoever shall seek to save
his life shall lose it; and wliosoever
shall lose his life shall preserve it
34 I tell you, ia that night there
s?hall be two rnen in one bed; the
one shall be taken, and tlio other

35 Two women shall ha griiKling

3 And tliere was a widow in that

Avenge me of mine adversary,

aflcrward he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard
man;
5 Yet because this widow tronbletli
me, I will iivonge her^ l&st hy her
continual coming she weary me.
G And the Lord said, Heai. what
the unjust judge saUli,
7 Anti shall not God avenge hia
own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with
them ? "
8 I tell you that he will avenge
them speedily, NevertheleeSj wtien
the Son of mati cometb, shall he find

0 And he gpake thi^ parable unto
certain which trusted in themselves
that they wereHgliteou$ and despised
others :
10 Two man went up into the
temple to pray; tho one a Pharisee^
and tlie otSier a publican»
11 Tlie Pharisee stood and prayed
tlms witli himself ； God ? I thank thee,
that I ara not as other men are f
extortioners, unjust ， adulterers, or
even as tliis pub'licaii,
12 工 fast tvviec in the 'veek，I give
tithes of all thftt I ]Possess,
13 And the publican,standing afar
ofT，would not lift up so much as kts
eyes unto heaven, but smote upon \m
breast, saying^ God be meroiful to rae
a sinner,
14 I tell you } this man went down
to his house justified rather than tlie
other : for every om that esalteth
him 册 If shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted*
15^ And they brougKt unto him
aiso infants, that he would tondi
them : but when his disciples saw U ?

of the Pharisees*
25 And they asked him, and said
unto him ? Why baptizest tbou then ，

baptize with water : but therestandeth

4 Nicodemus saitli onto bimj How
can a mail be born wKen he is old ?
can he enter the second time into
bis mothers womb, and be born?
5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily^ I
eay uwto tlice ； Except a mau be bom
of water find of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.
6 That which is bom of the flesh
is flesh; and that which la born of
the Spirit Is spirit.
7 marvel not that I said imto
thee^ Ye must be Lorn again.
8 The wind blowcth where it Iistetb,
and tliou hearest the sound thereof,
but canat not tell whence it cometli ?
and whither it goetli : so is every
one that is born of the Spirit.
9 Nlcodemua answered aad said
tin to him, How emi these things be?
10 Jesus answered and said unto
liinij Art thou a master of Israel,
and k no west not these things?
11 "V T enly, verily ? I say unto tliee,
We speak that we do know, and
testify that we have seen ; aod ye
receive not our witness.
12 If I have told you earthly tilings,
And ye believe not, how shall ye
believe 7 i£I tell you o/lieavenly tli ings?
13 And no mam hath ascended up
to heaven, but lie that camo clown
from lieaven, even tlie Son of man
which is hi heaven*
14 T[ And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up:
15 Tiiat whosoever believetii in
him should not perish ， but have
eternal life,
16 If For God so loved the world,
that lie gave his only begotten Son,
that wliosoever believeth in Mm
should not perish, btit have everlast¬

17 For God sent not his Son into

13 IIowbelt no man spake openly

14 1 Now about the midat of the
feast Jesus went up into the temple,
and taught,
15 And the Jews marvel led, say-
hig，How knowetli this mao letters^
having never learned ?
16 Jesus answered tliem ? and mld }
My doctrine is not mine^ but his that
sent tne.
n If any man will do his will, lie
shnll know of the doetriue，whether it
be of God^or whether I speak of myself, j
18 He that speaketli of himself
seeketh his own glory : bot lie that
eeekefcii liis glory that sent him，the
same k true, and no unrighteousness
is ia him.
19 Did not Moses give you t!ie law,
and yd none of you keepetli the law?
Why go ye about to kill me?
2D The people answered and said,
Tliou hast a devil i who goeth about
to kill thee?
21 Jesu$ answered and said unto
tbem ? I have done one work, and yet
ail marveL
22 Moses therefore gave unto yon
circuindsion ; (not becatasG ifc i s
Mo5€S 3 but of the fathers;) and ye on
the sabbath day circumcise a man*
23 If a nmn on the sabbath day
receive circumcision ； that the law of
Moses should not be broken ； are ye
angry at me, because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath
day?
24 Judge not according to the
appearance, but judge righteous
judgment,
25 Then said some of them of
Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom
they seek to kill ?
如 But ， lo，he epeaketh boldly,
and they my nothing nnto him.

frmn him, and he liatli sent me.
30 Then they solicit to take him :
but do man laid hands on liim,
because his hour was not jet come.
31 And many of the people be¬
lieved on andmkl，When Oirist
cornet]^ will he do more miracles than
these whicli this man Imth done ?
32 V The Pharisees heard that the
people murmured such things concern¬
ing him ; and the PJmrisees and the
chief priesfs seiit officers to take him*
33 Then said Jesus unto them,
Yet a little while am I with you, and
tkm I go onto him that sent me*
34 Ye shall seek me ? and shall not
find me! and where I am ? thilker
ye cannot come.
35 Then said t!ie Jews among
themselves. Whither will tie go, that
we shall not find him ? will lie go
imto tke dispersed among the Gen-
tiles, and teach the Gentiles ?
3G Wliafc of saying is this
tlmt lie Ye shall seek me, and
shall not find me : and where I am ，
thither ye cannot come ? i
37 In the last tlay, that great day
of the^feastj Jesus stood and cried,
sayings If any man let him
come unto me ; and drink,
38 He tliat bdieveth on as the
Scripture hath said，out of Ins belly
shall flow rivers of living water*
39 (But this spake he of the Spirit,
which they that believe on lii tn should
receive : for tlie Holy Ghost was not

258 St. JOHN, VIIL
40 H Many of tlie jseople thereforej,
when they heard tliig saying, said ，
Of a truth this is the Prophet*
41 Others said, This is the Christ.
But some said, Sli^U Christ; come
out of Galilee?
42 Hath not tlie Scripture said^ |
That Christ cometU of the seed of
J>avldj and out of the town of Beth-
lelxcm^ where David was ?
43 So there was a division among
th e people because of him,
44 And some of tliem would iiave
taken him j but no man laid hands
on him,
45 t Then came the officers to the
chief priests and Pharisees j and they
Bakl unto them. Why iiave ye not
brought hhn?
46 Tlie officers answered ? Kever
man spake like this man,
47 Then answered them the Pliati-
eees ? Are ye also deceived ?
48 Have any of the rulers or of
tlie Pharifiees believed on him ?
49 But this people who knoweth
not the law are cursed.
50 Wioodemua saitlx unto them ，
(lie that came to Jasus by niglit^
bein^ one of them,)

3 And the scribes and PhftrisecB
brought I info him a woman taken i n

4 They say unto him. Master, this
woman w 贴 taken in ndulter^j in the

5 Now Moses in the law com¬
manded uSj that such should be
stoned : but what saycst tbou ?
6 This they said，tempting him,
that they might have to accuse him*
But Jesus stooged dovm } mid with
M$ finger wrote on the ground^
though ha heard them not
7 So when they continuetl asking
him，lie lifted upjiimeelf } aud said unto
He tliat is without sin among
you t let him first cast a stone at her*
8 Am! again lie stooped dovm ，
and wrote on the ground.
9 And they which heard being
convicted by their own conscience,
went cmfc oue by ooCj beginning at
the eldest, etm unto tllast : and
Jesus was left alone, and the woman
standing in the midst,
10 Whoa Jesus had lifted U2> him¬
self, and saw none but tlio woman^
he md irnto \ier t Woman, where are
those tliino accusers ? hath no man
condemned thee?
11 She saidj Ko nmii, Lord. And
Jesus said unto her^ Neither do I
couderau tlico r go t and sin no more*
12 Tf Then spake Jesus again unto
them, saying, I am the light of the
world : he that followeth me shall
not walk in darkness, but shall have
t]ie light of life*
13 The Pharisees therefore said
unto Iiinij Tliou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true,
14 Jesus answered md eixki tmto

16 Yo judge after the flesh; I
judge no man,
10 And yet if I juclgGj my judg¬

17 It h also written in yom law,
that tl io toBtimony of two men is true.
1B I am one tlmt bear witness of
myself, and the Fatlier that sent me
bearclh witness of me,
1D Tlien said they unto liiiu, Where
3s tiiy Father ? Jesus anavvered, Ye
neitlier know rae，nor my Father : if
ye liad known me, yt should have
known my Father also,
20 These words spake Jesus in tlie
treasury^ as lie taught in tlie temple :
and no man kid hands on him f for
liis hour was not yet come.
21 Tlien said Jesur3 again utito
then)^ ! go my way ? mid ye shall seek

I go 3 ye cannot corae,
22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill
hi in self? beomise he sftith, Wlnthei'
I go, yo can I tot e 細 e.
23 And he said unto them ? Ye are
from beaefttli; I am ftxsm above : ye arc
of this world ; I am not of this world*
24 I said lliercfbro unto you, that
ye shall die in your sins : for if ye
believe not tlmt V am he } ye shall die
in your sins.
25 Then said they unto him, Who
art thou ? And Jesus gaith unto
them ， E\eu the mme that T mid
unto you from the beginning,
26 I liave many tilings to say and
to judge of you ； but he that sent me
is true; and I speak to die world those
things which I lmve lieard of him.
27 They imderstood not that lie
spake to them of the Father*
28 Then said Jesus unto them,
When ye have lifted up tlie Bon of

9 Much people of the Jews there¬
fore knew that he was there : and
tliey came not for Jestis' sake only,
btit that they might seis Lazarus also,
whom he had raised from the dead*
10 But the chief priests consulted
that tlicy might put Lazarus aim to
death;
11 Because that by reason of bico
many of the Jews went awa}% and
believed on Jesus*
12 1 Go the aext day much people
that were come to the feast，when
they heard that Jesus was coming
to Jerusalem^
13 Took branches of palm trees,
and went forth to meet him，and
cried ? Ho 册 mm r Bkssed is tlie King
of Israel that cometh in the name of
tlie Lord*
14 And Jesus f when he had found
^ young sat fcherean; as it is
written,
15 Fear not, daughter of Sion :
behold, thy King cometli, sitting on
an ass’s colt.
16 These tilings understood not his
disciples at the first : but when Jesns
was glorified ^ then remembered they
that these things were written of
liipi, and that they had done these
things unto him,
17 The people therefore that s_
with kim wlien he called Lazarus
out of his grave ? and raised him
from the dca3，bare record*
For this cause the people also
mefc him, for that they heard that
!ie Imd done this miracle,
19 The Pharisees therefore said
among themselve,s ? Perceive ye how
y« pr?vail nothing? beliold, the
world ia gone after him.

It is expedient for you that I go

T depart, I will send him unto you*
8 And when he is come, he will
reprove the world of sin，and of

That ye shall weep and lament，but

16 But Peter stood at tlie door
without Then went out that otlier

that kept the door ? ami brouglit in

17 Then eaith the damsel that
kept thfi door unto Petor, Art not

He saifl]，I am not.
18 And the servants and officers
stood tiiere^ who Imd made a fire of

warmed tliemselvcs? ami Peter stood

19 If The high priest then asked
Jesus of his disciples, an<J of h^s
doctrine,
20 Jesus answered I spake
openly to the world; I ever taught
iji tlie synagogue, imd in the tetnplc ?
wliitber the Jews always resort; and
in secret have 1 said nothing,
21 Why askest thou me? ask
them wiiich heard me, what I
said unto them : beliold^ tlrey know
what I said.
22 And when he had thus spoken^
one of the owners which stood by
struck Jesus witii tho palm of big
hantl^ saying，A ns wo rest tbou the
higli priest so ?
23 Jesus answered liim 3 If I have
spoken evil, bear witness of the evil :
but if wellj why s mi test thou me ?
24 Now Armas ]iad 閱 nt him

章八十笫翰約
28 1 Tlien led tliey Jesus from
Caiiiphas unto the hall of judgment :
and it was early \ and they themselves
went not into the jiulgment Iiall, lest
they should be defiled; but tlmt they
might eat the passover.
29 Pilate then went out uato them ，
mid said, What accusatiaa bring ye
against this man?
SOThcja ns wer etl a nd sa i d u otohiin ?
If he were not a male factor, we would
not have delivered Mm up unt 。 thee*
31 Then Baid Pilate mito themj
Take ye him ? and judge him accord-
ing to your law. The Jews therefore
said onto him, It is not lawful for ua
to put any man to death :
32 That the saying of Jeans might
be fallilkdj which he spake^ signify^
ing wliat death lie should die.
33 Then Pilate entered into the
judgment hall again ? and called
JesiixSj and said unto him ? Art tliou
the King of the Jews?
34 Jesus answered him, Sayesfc
tliou this thing of tliyself ? or did
others tell it thee of me?
So Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?
Thine own nation and the chief
priests have delivered ibee imto me:
wlmt hast thou done ?
30 Jesus answered, My kingdom
is not of tliis world : If my kingdom
were of tins world f then would my
servant fight, that I should not be
delivered to tbe Jews i but now is
my ktiigdom not from hence-
37 Pilate therefore said imto him ?
Aittlioo a king then? Jesus answered^
Thou suyest. tliat I am a king. To
this end was I bom, and for tins cause
came I into tbe world, that I should
hear witness unto the truth* Every one
that, is of the truth licareth my voice.
38 l 1 11 ate saith uoto liim，Wlmt is
truth? And when be liad said this,
lie went out. again unto tlie Jews^ mid
saith imto them j I iltid in him ixq

4 Therefore they that were scatter¬

5 Then Philip went down to the
city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.
6 And the people with oue accord
gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the

This man ia the great power of God t

18 And when Simon eaw that
tjurough laying on of the apostles’
hands the Holy Ghost was given 7 he
offered them money,
19 Saying, Give me also this power ，
that on whomsoever I ky hands) he
may receive the Holy Ghost,
20 But Peter said tmto Iiim ; Thy
money perish with thee ? because thou
liast thought that the gift of God
tnaj he purclmsecl with money*
21 Tliou hast neither part nor lot
in this matter : for thy heart is not
right in the sight of God,
22 Repent therefore of tMs thy
wickedness, and pray God y if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be
forgiven thee,

me that I should not call any man
common or unclean,
2d Therefore came I unto you
without gaitisayingj as soou as J was

30 And Cornelius said^ Four days

aud at the niutli hour I prayed lo
my hotisej and ， beliold, a man stood
before me in bright clothing ，
31 And said ? CornelmSj thj prayer

Tvith power : who went about doing

oppressed of the devil ； for God was
■with Mm.
39 And we are witnesses of all
things which he did both in the land
of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom
they slew and hanged oa a tree :
40 Him God raised op the third
day, and shewed Mm openly ;
41 Kot to all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God, even
to iiSj who did eat and drink vvith
him after he rose from the dead,
42 And he commanded us to
prcack unto the people and to testify
that it is lie wliich was ordairied of
God to be the Judge of quick and
dead*
43 To him give all the prophets
witness, tliat through his name who¬
soever belieyetli in him shall receive
remission of sins.
44 If While Peter yet spake these
words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them which heard the word,
4o And they of tlie dreumclsion
winch believed were astonished^ as
many as came with Peter, because
that on the Gentiles also 、\邮 poured
out the gift of tlie Holy Ghost*

A certain vessel desoendj as it had
been a great eheet^ let down from
heaven by four corners ; and it came
even to me :
6 Upon the wliich when I Imd
fastened mine I considered, and
saw four foot eel beasts of the earth,
and wild beasts ； and creeping things ，
and fowls of the air.
7 And I heard a voice saying unto
me ， Arise, Peter; slay and cat.
8 But I said. Not so，Lord : for
aothiog common or unclean hath at
an 7 time entered into my month,
9 But the voice answered me
again from heaven, AViiat God hath
cleansed ? that call not thou ooromon,
10 xluci tliis was done three timea :
and all were drawn up again into
heaven.
11 Andj behold ? imniedilately there
three men nlready come unto

12 And the Spirit bade me go with
them ? nothing doubting* Moreover

more to returu to corruption^ he said
on this wise, I will give yoa the sure
jnercies of David,
35 Wherefore lie saiUi also in
another psalm 9 Thou sbalt not suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption-
For Davit!, after he liad served
his own generation by ibe will of
Godj fell on sleep, and was kid
unto his Others, and saw corruption :
37 But he, whom God raised flgain^
saw no comiption.
38 Tf Be H known unto you tlierc-
fore 3 nicn and brethren, that through

forgiveness of sins i
39 And by him all tlmt believe are
justified from all things, from which
ye coiikl not be justified by the law
of Mosf s,
40 Beware therefore, lest i\mt come
upon you, which is spoken of h in the
prophets;
41 Behold, ye despisers, an<l won¬
der, and perish : for I work a work
id your days, a work wbicli ye shflli
in no wise believe, though a man
declare it unto you.
42 And when th$ Jews were
gone out of the synagogoe ? the
Geatilcs besought that these words
might be preached to iliem tlie next

4S Now when, the congregation was
broken up, many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul arid
Barmibfis; \\ho f speaking to them,
persuaded them to continue in the

and blaspheming. ^

the chief men of the city, and raised
persecution against Paul and Burna-

testified of me in Jerusalem，so must
thou bear witness also at Borne,
12 Anti when it was day ? certaui of
the Jews banded together，and bound
tliemseives under a cursej saying that
they would neither eat nor drink till

13 And they were more than forty
which had made this conspiracy,
14 And they came to the eliief
priests and elder^ and said，We have
bound ourselves under a great corse,
that we will eat nothing until we
have alaio Pau!*
15 Now therefore ye with the
council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to

that they will neither eat nor drmk

21 Btit after long abstinence，Paul
stood forth in the midst of them, and
said ， Sirs, ye should have hearkened

Crete, and to have gained this harm
and loss.
22 And now I exhort you to be of
good cheer : for there sliatl bo no loss
of any man } s life among voiij but of

23 For there stood by rae this
night the augel of GoJ, whose I am ，
and wboni I mr\t ?
24 Saying，Fear not ， Paul; thou
must be brought before Cesar t and,
lo^ God iiath given thee all them that
sail with thee*
25 Wherefore ， sirs, be of good
cheer : for I bslleve God ? that it shall
be even aa it was told me
26 Howbeit we must be cast upon

27 But when the fourteoiitli night

shipnieu deemed that they drew near

28 And soimdedj and found it
twenty fathoms: and when they had
gone a little fur the i t , they soimded
again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
29 Then fearing lest we sliould
ImYt fallen upon rocks，they cast four
anchors out of the stern, and willed

30 And as the shipmen were about
to flee otit of the ship, wlicn they lmd
let down tlie boat into the sea，micler

37 And we were m all in the ship

the centurion delivered tlie prisoners

24 And some believed the things
which were spoken, and some be¬
lieved Dot,

themselves, they departed, after that
Paul had spoken one word) Well
spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias tlie
prophet unto our fathers,
26 Saying, Go uoto this people,
and say f Hearing ye shall hear, and
shall not understand; and seeing
ye shall see, and not perceive :
27 For the heart of this people is
waxed gross, and their ears are dull
of hearings and their eyes have they
closed; lest they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears ? and
understand with their heart, and
slionM be converted, and I should
heal them,
28 Ee it known therefore unto
you, that the salvation of Gotl h
sent unto the (a-entileSj, and ihtd tliev

words, the Jews departed’ aad Iiad

3 Wov what the law conld not doj
m that it was weak through the

4 That the righteousness of the law
Hiight be fulfilled in us，who walk not
after the flesh ? but after the Spirit*
5 For they that are after tlie flesh
do mind the things of tlie flesh; but
they that are after the Spirit, the
things of the Spirit.
6 For to be carnally minded is
death; but to te spiritually minded
is life and peace.
7 Because the carnal mind is
enmity against God i for it is not
subject to the law of God ; neither
indeed can be.
8 So then they that are in the
flesh cannot please God.
9 Bat ye are not 5a the flesh, but
in t^e Spirit, if so be that the Spirit
of God dwell in you. Now if any
man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he ia none of his,
10 And if Christ b6 in jon } the

Spirit is life because of righteousness ，
11 But if the Spirit of him that
raised lip Jesus from the dead dwell

16 The Spirit itself bearetb witness
ivitli our spirit，that we are the chil¬
dren oi' God :
17 And if diildren, then heirs;
heirs of God, and joint heirs with
Christ ; if so be that we suffer with
him t that we may be also glorified
together,
18 For I reckon that the sufFeringa
of tins present time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory which
ghall be revealed m us.
19 For the earnest expectation of
the creature waiteth for the raanifes-
tation of the sons of God*
20 For the creature was made
subject to vanity, not wlHingly, but
by reason of him who liath subjected
the same in hope;
21 Because the creature itself also
shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption into the glorious liberty
of tlie cbUdrtiii of God,
22 For we know that the whole
creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now,
23ArnI not only they, but ourselves
ako* which have the first fruits of
the Spirit, even we ourselves groaa
Tvitbiti ours^-ives, waiting for the
adoption, to wit ， the redemption of
our body.
24 For we are saved by jjope : but
hope that is seen is not hope : for
what a man eeeth, why doth lie yet
hope for ?
25Butif we hope for that wc see not,
then do we with patience wait for it
26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth
our infirmities : for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought :
but the Spirit itself maketh inter-
for us with groaaings which
ca I mot be uttered.
27 And he that aearcheth the
hearts knoweth what is tlie mind of
the Spirit because be maketh inter¬
cession ibr the saints according to
the will of God.

28 For he will finish tho work, and
cut it short in righteousness: because
a short work will the J^ord make

29 And as Ksaias £ aid before^ Ex¬
cept the Lord of Sabaotii had left u,^

30 Wliat shall we say then ? That
the Gentila% which followed not after
righteousness, have attained to right-
eousness^ even the righteousness
which is of faith.
31 But Israel, wlncli followedafter
the law of Tighteousncas, hath not
attained to the law of righteousness*
32 Wherefore? Because they sought
it not by fiiithj but as it were by the
works of the law. For they stumbled
at that stomblingstone;
33 As it is written, Behold ? I lay
in Sion 狂 stumblings;tone and rock of

him strnll tiot be ashamed,
CHAPTER X

3 For they, being ignorant of GocPs
righteousness, ami going about to
establish their own rigfiteouyaessj
have nofc submitted themselves unto

4 Par Christ is the end of the law

9 That if thou shalt confess with

10 For with the heart man be¬
lie veth unto righteousness; and with

11 For the Scripture saitk ? Who¬
soever believeth on him shall not be

12 For there is no difference
between, the Jew and the Greek : for
the paitie Lord over all is rich unto

3 For even Christ pleased not

4 For wlsatsoover things were writ¬
ten aforetime were written for our
learning that we through patience
anti comfort of the Scriptures might j
have hope.
5 Now the God of patience and
consolation grant you to be lifcemind-

Christ Jesus :
0 That ye may with one mind and
one moutli glorify God 少 even the
ITaiher of our Lord Jesus Christ*
7 Wherefore receive ye one an-
otlier, as Christ also received uSj to
the glory of God,
8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was
a minister of the eircmucisioh for tho
truth of God, to confirm the promises
made tiato tho fathers :
9 And tliat the Gentiles might
glorify God for his mercy; as it is
written^ For this cause I will confess

12 And again, Esaias saith ? There
shall be a root of Jesse, and he that
shall rise to reign over the Gentiles;
in him siiall the Gentiles trust,
13 Now the Got! of hope fill you
with all joy aud peace in believing ，
that ye may abound in liope, through
tlie power of the Holy Ghost.

glory through Jesus Cljrist in those
things whicli pertain to God.
18 For I will not dare to speak of
nnv of those tilings which Christ
liath not wrought by me，to make
the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed,
19 Througli miglitjaigns and won¬
ders, by tlie power of the Spirit of
God ; m tliat from Jerusalem, and
round about unto Jllyricum, I have
fully prenched the gospel of Christ.
20 Yea，so have I strived to preach
tlie gospel^ not where Christ was
named, lest I should build upon
another man’s foundation :
21 But as It is writteiij To whom
he was not spoken of, tliey shall see :
ami they that have not lieard shall
understand.
22 For whicli cause also I liave
been much hindered from eoDiing

23 But now having no more place
in these parts, and having a great
desire these mfinj years to come
unto you;
24 Whensoever I lake my journey

trust to see you in ray journey，and
to be brought on my way thitherward

12 Now this I say, that every one
of you Baith, I am of Paul; and I
of Apollo ^； and I of Cephas; and 1
of Clirist.
13 Is Christ divicktl? was Paul
cruoifiod for you ? or we re y e liapti zed
in the name of Paul?
14 I thank God that I baptized
none of you ? but Crispus suid Gaius;
15 Ijest any should my that I Iiad
baptized in mine own name.
16 And I baptized also the house¬
hold of Stephanas : besides, I know
not whether I baptised aoy other.
17 For Christ sent me not to
baptizes but to preach the gospel :
not with wisdom of words, lest the
cross of Christ should be made of
none effect,
18 For the preaching of the cross
is to them that perish, foolishness i
but onto us winch are saved, it is the
power of God.
19 For it is written, I will destroy
tlie wisdom of the wise，and will
bring to nothing the miderstandhig
of the prudent*
20 Where is the wise ? ^vliere
the scribe ? where is the disputer of
this world?hath not God made fooHsh
the wi&dom of this world ?
21 For after that in the wisdom
of God the world by wisdom knew
not, Goclj it pleased God by the fool-
ishuess of preaching to save them
that believe.
22 For the Jews require a sjgo ?
and the Greeks seek after wisdom :
23 But we preach Christ crudfkd,
imto the Jews a stumbIingbIock 7 and
unto the Greeks foolishness ;
24 But unto tliem which are culledj
footli Jews ami Greeks, Christ the
power of God, and the wisdom of
God* k!
25 Because the foolishness of God
is wiser than men ; and the weaklier
of God is stronger than men.

I have a reward : but if against my
will，a dispenimtion of the gospel is
committed unto me,
18 What is my reward then ?
Verily tba^ when I preach the gospel ?
X may make the gospel of Christ
without cl]arge 3 tlmt I abuse not my
power in the gospel.
19 For though I be free from all
yet have I made myself servant
unto all, that : might gain the more,
20 And unto the Jews I became
as a Jew，that I might gain the Jews ;
to them that are uiidei 1 the law,
under the law ? that I might gain
them that are and or tlie law ;
21 To them tJiat are without law,
as without law，(being not without
law to God，but under the law to
Christ,} thiit I might gain them tJhat
are without law*
22 Co the weBk became I m weak^
that I might gain the weak : I am
made all things to all mm that I
might by all means save some,
23 And this I do for the gospel’s
8ftke^ that I might be partaker thereof
with you.
24 Know ye not that they which
run in a race run all ? but one

ye vtmy obtain,
25 And every mail that strivefh
for the mastery is temperate in all
things. Now ihey do it to obtain a
corruptible crown ; but we an in cor'
ruptible.
26 I therefore so run, not as un-
eertaiuly * so fight I, not ns one that
beateth tlie air ：
27 But I keep under my body ?
and bring it Into subjection : lest
that by any means, when I have

7 JSeitlier be ye idolaters, as were

6 And there are diversities of
operations, but it ia the same God
which worketh all in all.
7 Bat the rnanifestatiou of the

that my joy is (he joy of you alh
4 For out of much affliction and

CHAFTEE IV,
rpHEEEFOTlE, seeing we lmve
丄 this ministry^ a3 we liave
received mercy, we faint not;
2 But have renounced tlie hidden
tilings of dishonest 7 , not walking in
craftiness, nor handling the word of
God deceitfully j but, by manifesta¬
tion of the truth, commending our-
eelves to every manb conscience in
tlie sight of God,
3 But if our gospel be hid ? it is
liid to them that are lost :
4 In whom the god of this world
hath blinded the miiida of
which believe not ? lest the light of
the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
the image cf God, should shine unto
them.
5 For we preach not ourselves,
but Christ Je^us tiie Lord; aad
ourseiTes your servants for Jesus’
sake,
6 For God, who oomnmnded the
light to shine out of darkness，hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God
iu the face of Jesns Christ,
7 But we have this treasure ia
earthen vessels, that the excellency
of llie power may be of God ? and not
of us.
B We are troubled on every side ，
jet not distressed ; we are perplexed,
but not ia despair 5
9 Persecuted ? but not forsaken;
cast down, but not destroyed;
10 Always bearing about in the
body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
that tlie life also of Jesus might be
made manliest iti our body.
11 For we v^hlch live are alw&y
delivered mi to death for Jesus’ sake,
that the life also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our mortal flesh.

， 11 Xow therefore perform the do-
Ing of it; that as there was a. readiness
to willj, so there 7h<iy be a pe^formaii^e
also out of that whidi ye have.
12 For if there be first a ivilling
raindj it is accepted aceordiDg to
that a man hath, and not according
to that he batii not,
13 3^or jf mean not. tliat other men
be eased 3 and ye burdened :
14 But by an equality, that now
at tliis time your abundaace may be
* supjyly for their want, that their
abuiulance also maj be a supply for
your want; that there maybe equality:
15 As it is written, fee that had
gathered much ]iad nothing over; and
he that hadgathered little bad nolack.
But tlmuks be to God, which
put the same earnest care into the
heart of Titus for you*
17 For indeed ise accepted the ex¬
hortation j but being more forward ，
of lus own accord he went unto you,

CHAPTER I.
an apostle, (not of men ，
I neither by tmn，but by Jesus
Christy and God the Father^ who
raided him from the dead;)
2 And all the brethren which are
with me, unto the ctmrclies of
Galatia:
3 Grace to you^ and poaec, from
Gotl the Father，and from our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4 Who gave hitnself for our Bins ?
that he ral^lit deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the
will of God and our Fatljer :
5 To whom be glory for ev^r and
ever. Amen-
6 1 marvel that yo are SO soon
removed from him that ealled you
into the grace of Christ imto another
gospel :
7 Which is not another; but
there be some tluit trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ
8 But tliough we, or an angel from
heaven ? preach any otlier gospel unto
you tlmu that which we have preached
unto you t let him be accursed,
d As we said before^ so say I now
flgain^ If any man preach any other
gospel onto you tliau that ye have
received, let him bo accursed
10 For do I now persuade men,
or God ? or flo I seek to please men ?
fo* h if I yet pleased men, 1 should not
be the servant of Christ,
11 Bat I certify you ? bretliren,
that the} gospel wliicli was preached
of me is not after main
12 For I neither received it of
mm, liei titer was 1 taugjifc it t but bjr
the revtla^iOD of Jesus Christ.

13 For ye have heard of my ooa-
vernation In time past in tlie Jews’
religion ； how that beyond measure I
persecuted the clmrcli of God, and
wasted it :
14 And profited in fcbeJe^V religion
above many my equals in mine own
nation, being more exceedingly Keal^
ous of the traditions of ray fathers.
15 But when it pleased God, who
separated me from my mother’s
womb, nu<J called me by iiis grace ，
16 To reveal \m Son in me，that
I might prcacli him among the
heatlu?a; Immediately I conferred
not witli fiesb and blood :
17 Neither went 1 up to Jernsalem
to them which were n pasties before
me; but I went into Arabia^ and
returnecl again unto Damascua^
18 Then after three years I went
up to Jerusalem to see Peter ? and
abode with him fifteen days.
19 But other of the apostles saw I
none, save James the LorcVs brother.
20 Now the things which I write
unto you, t^hold, beforeGod^ 1 He not. 〜 ^
21 Afterwards I came into the ^ ^
rcgioiis of Syria and Cilicia j 於默
22 And 'vas tiukuown by face ^

were in Christ:
2S But they had heard only. That
lie winch persecuted us in times past
now preacheth tlie faith which once
he destroyed

14 Bwt when I saw that they

and not as do the, Jews, why compel-
lest tiiou tlie Gentiles to live ns do
the Jews ?
15 \Xg who are Jews by imtuie ，
a ad not sinners of tlie GcntHes,
16 Knowing that fi man is not
justified by tlie work a of the 1 aw ； but
by the faith of Jesus Claris^ even we
have believed in Jesus Christ, that
tvc might be justified by the faith of
Christ, and not by the works of the
law: jfbr by the works of the law
shall no flesh be justified,
17 But if, while we seek to be
justified by Christy ^ve ourselves also
are found sinnera, is therefore Christ
the minister of sin ? God forbid.
18 For if I build again the things
which I destroyed ? I malce toysolf a
transgressor,
19 For I through the law am dead to
the ]aw, that I might live unto God,
20 I am crucified with Christ ：
nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me : and the life
which 1 now live in tlie flesh I live

2S But lie who was of the bond-

he of the free woman wa$ by promise^
24 Which things are an allegory :
for these are tlie two covenants; the
oae from tlie mmint Sinai, which
gendereth to bondage, which is Agar,
25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in
Arabia, and anawereth to Jemsalem
which now is, and ia in bondage

27 For it is written^ Rejoice, thou

and erv, thou that travaikst not : for
tlie desolate hatli many more children

28 Now we，breihreuj as Isuac

29 But as tlien he that born after

he that soweth to the Spirit shall of
the Spirit reap life everlasting.

11 Ye see how large a letter I
have written unto you with mine
own hand,
12 As many as desire to make a
fair shew in the flesh, they constrain
you to be circumcised ; only lest tiiey
should suffer persecution for the crass
of Christ.
IS For neither they tlieraseIves
who are circumcised keep the law;
but desire to have you eircuincisedj
that they may glory in your fleshy
14 But God forbid that I should
glory ^ save id the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world m
crucified unto me ? and I. unto the

circumcision availeth any thing, nor
tmcireumcision ? but a new creature.

26 For he Longed after yo u al 1 ， and

27 For indeed he was side nigh

5 For our gospel came not unto

assurance; as ye know what maimerof
men we were among you for your sake*
6 And ye became followers of ua ，
and of the Lord, having received the
word in much affliction, with joy of
the Holy Ghost:
7 So that ye were ensaraples to all
that belie vein Macedonia and Achaia.
B For from you sounded out the
word of the Lord not only in Mace¬

place your faitla to God-ward is
spread abroad; so that we need not
to speak any thing.
9 For they themselves sliew of us

, 2 For yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief ia the night,
3 For when they shall sny. Peace
and safety; then auddeu destruction
cometli upon them，as travail upon a
woraao with child j and they shall
not escape.
4 But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness^ that that day diould over¬
take you as a thief.
5 Ye are all the children of light,
and the children of the day : we are
not of the night, nor of darkness,
6 Therefore let m not slepp, ns do
others; but let us watch and be sober.
7 For they that sleep sleep in the
ni^ht; and they that be d rim ken
are dnmkeu in the night,
8 But let us, who are of the day ?
be sober ^ putting oa tlie brea^tplafe
of faitli and love ; and for a helmet,
the hope of saJvatimu
9 For God lmth not appointed us
to wrntb 3 but to obtain salvation by
our Lord Jesus Christ,
10 Wlio died for us, that, wltether
we wake or sleep, wq should live to¬
gether with him.

7 For J jourselves know how ye
ought to follow us : for behaveti
not ourselves disorderly among you;
S Neither did we eat any man^e
bread for nought; but wrought wltli
labour and travail night and Jay,
that we might not be chargeable to
imy of yon :
9 Not because we liave not pawei^
l>ut to make ourselves an ensample
unto you to follow us.
10 For even when we were with
you, this we oomrmuicletl you, thafe
if any would not work, neither
ehould he eat.
11 For we hear that there are
some which walk among you dis-
csrderly 5 working not at allj but are

12 Now them that are such we
comm arid and ^xhorfc by our Lord

workj and eat their own bread,

10 Therefore I endure all things
for the olect ? s sake，that they may

11 It is a faitljfol saying : For if

VV partakers of the heavenly
calling, consider tlio Apostle aad
High Priest of our profession, Climfc
Jesiis ;
2 Wbo was faithful to him that
appointed iiim, as also Moses was
faithful in all his house.
3 For this man was counted
worthy of raore glory than Moses,
Inasmuch as lie who hatli builded
the hon$e hath more lionour thaa
the house,
4 For every liouse is buikled hy
some nian; but he that built all
things is God,
5 And Moses verily wa 线 ikithful
in all liis house as a servant, for a
testimony of those things which were
to be spoken after ;
6 But Onist as a son over his
own house ; whose bouse ^re we ? if
we bold fast the confidence and the
rejoicing of the hope firm unto the
end,
7 Wherefore ns the Holy Ghost
saith，To day if ye will liear bis
voice ，
8 Harden not your hearts ? as in
the provocation, in the clay of temp¬
tation m the wikkrne&^ :
9 When your fathers tem])ted me,
proved me ，&nd saw my works forty
years,
10 'V here fore I was grieved with
that generation^ and said，They do
always err in thdr heart; and tliej
Lave not known my wayg.
11 Bo I svrare jii my wrath ? They
nlinil not enter into my rest.
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there
be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the liv¬

12 That ye be act slothfuI } but
followers of them wlio through faith

13 For when God made protoiee
to Abraham, because he could swear
by no greater, he sware by himself,
14 Sayingj Surely blessing I will
bless thee, and multiplying I will
multiply tliee.
15 And iso, after he had patiently
endured, he obtained the promise.
16 For men verily swear by the
greater : and an oath for coniirnia-
tion is to them an end of all strife.
17 Wherein 6od s willing more
abundantly to sliew unto the heirs
of promise the imniutabflity of his

14 For it is evident that oar Lord
sprang out of Juda; of which tribe
Moses spake nothing concerning
priestbood.
16 And it Is yet far more evident :
for that after the similitude of Mel-
cbisetlec there arbcth another priesti,
If! Who is ma<le 3 not after the
law of a carnal commandment, Imfc
after the power of an eudkss life*
]7 Por he Thou art a
priasfc for ever after the order of
Melchisedec*
15 For there is verily a disannul¬
ling of the commandment going be¬
fore for the weakness and itnprofit¬
ableness thereof,
19 For the law made nothing
perfect^ but the bringing in of a
better hope did; by the which we
draw nigh unto God.
20 And inasmucli as not without
an oath lie was made priest .*
21 (For those priests were made
without an oath; but this witli an
oath by him that said imto him^
The Lord sware and will not repcot ?
Thou art a priest for ever after the

22 By so mucli was Jesus made

7 By^faith JSoah ? being warned

9 By faith he sojourned in the
land of promise, as in a strange

10 For he looked for a city which

15 Through faith also Sara

CHAPTER I.
OIMON Petei\ a servant and an
O apostle of Jesns Cbriafc ? to them
that have obtained like precious faith
witli ;is through the righteousness
of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
2 Grace and peace be multiplied
unto you through the knowledge of
God, and of Jesus our Lord,
3 According as his divine power
hath given unto m all things that
pertain unto life and godliness^
through tbe knowledge of him that
hath called m to glory and virtue :
4 Whereby are given unto us ex¬
ceed i Eg great and ]irecions promises;
that by these je might be par inkers
of the divine nature，having escaped
the corruption that is lii the world
through lust.
5 An^ be&ides this, giving all
diligence，add to your faith virtue ;
and to virtuej knowledge ;
6 And to kiiowleflge ? temperance;
and to temper a nee, patience; and
to patiencej gorlluicss ；
7 And togodlinesSj brotherly kind-
ness；Evnd tobrotl icrlykinthi e?s,cli arity.
8 For if these things be in you, and
abmnidj they make you that shaU
neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ*
9 But he that lacketh these things
is blind, and cftnnot see afar off ? and
hath forgotten that he was purged
fro eh IiIb old sins-
10 Wherefore the ratlier, breth¬
ren, give diligence to make your
ctilllng and election sure : for if ye

18 And this voice which came
from heaven we liciird^ when we

4 Whasoever com mittetli Bin trans^

transgression of the law,
5 And ye know that he was

S He that ©ommitteth sin is of

that lie might destroy the works of

5 Beloved, tbou doest faithfully!
whatsoever thou doest to the brcth-
reiij and to strangers j
6 Whicli liave boriie witness of
thy charity bo&re the chnrcli :
whom if thou bring forward on their
journey after a godly sort, thou
shalt do well :
7 Because that : for liis name’s sake
they went £orlli ? taking nothing of
the Gentiles.
S We therefore ought to receive
mch t that we might be fellow help¬
ers to the truth.
9 I wrote unto the church : but
Diotreplies, who IovetK to have the
preeminence among tliera, reoeiveth
ns not,
10 Wherefore ? if I come, I will
romember his deeds which lie doeth ?
prating against us with tudici 哪
words : and not content therewitli ?
neither doth he himself receive the
bretlireo, and forblddetli them that
would, and casteth them out of tlio
cliurch*
11 Beloved^ follow not that which
is evllj but that which is good. He
that doeth good Is of God : but lie
that doeth evil hath not seen GotL
12 Demetrius Imth good report of
all men, and of the truth Itself : yea,
and we aho bear record; and ye
know that out record is true*
13 I Jiad many things to write,
but I will not with ink and pen
write unto tliee;
14 But I trust I sliall shortly see
thee, and we shall speak face to
face. Peace be to thee* Our friends
salute thee. Greet the friends by

THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF
JUDE.
丁 UDT5, the servant of Jesus Christy
J tmd brother of James, to them
that are snnetified God the
Fatlier, and preserved in Je^us
Chiist, and called :
2 Mercy unto you, and peace，and
love, be multiplied.
Z Belovedj wlien I gave &11 dilU
gence to write unto you of the
common salvation ? it was need fill
for ine io write unto yoi^ and exhort
you that ye should earnestly contend
for the faitli wliich was ouoe de¬
livered trntQ the saints*
4 For there are.,.certain men crept
i a unawares^ who were before of
old ordained to this eon deni nation,
ungodly men，turning the grace of
our God into laaciyicHisness, and
denying only Lord awd
our Lord Jesus Christ*
5 I will therefore put you in
remembrance, though ye once knew
this, how that the J-roed, having
saved the people out of the land of
Egypt^ afterward de^troy^d them
that believed not*
6 And the angels which kept not
their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved ia
everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of the great
day.

CHAPTER IX.
A ND the fifth angel soitndedjand
I saw a star fall from heaven
unto the earth i and to him was
given the key of tlie bottomless pih
2 And he opened the boUomle^
pit; and there arose a smoke out of
the pitj as the einoke of a great
furnace; and the sun and the air
w 奴 e darkened by reason of the
smoke of the pit*
S And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the earth; and unto them
was given power，as the scorpions of
the earth have power.
4 And it was commanded them
that they should not hurt: the grass
of the earthy neither any green tiling,
neither any tree; but ottly those men
which have not the seal of God in
their forelieacla*
5 And to them it was givea tlmt
they should not kill them, but
that they should be tormented five
months : find their torment tvas aa
the torment of a ecorpLon > when he
striketb » man*
6 And in those days shall men
seek deatlij and shall not find it; and
shall desire to die，and death shall
flee from them*
7 Ancl the shapes of tlie locusts
were like unto horses prepared mdo
battle; and on their 1 leads we)*e as it
were crowns like gold，and their faces
wm*e as the faces of men.
8 And they had hair as tlie liair of
women, aud their teeth were as the
teeth of lionfi,
d And tliey had breastplateSj as
it were breastplates of iron; aud the
sound of tlieir wings was as the sound
of chariots of mnny horses running
to battle.
10 And they had tails like rnito
scorpionSj and there were stings ia
their tails : their power wm to
hart men five months.

their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders
had uttered their voices ， I was about
to write : and I heard a voice from
heaven saying imto me^ Seal up tliose
things which the eev T en tlitra^ers
uttered ; and write them not.
5 And the angel which I saw stand

lifted up his hand to lieayeiij
